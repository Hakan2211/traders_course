## Trading the Corporate Survival Manipulation Cycle

### The Desperate Company Playbook

We're entering territory that most trading courses won't touch: the mechanics of corporate desperation and systematic market manipulation.

The setups you've learned so far — ORBs, News Plays, Parabolic Shorts — these trade natural market dynamics: supply and demand, momentum exhaustion,
mean reversion. They're organic patterns that emerge from millions of traders interacting.

The Reverse Split Long and Short setups are different.<br/>
These trade a manufactured cycle created by companies on the edge of delisting, with no fundamental business,
surviving by using the stock market as an ATM. These companies don't have products, revenue, or customers.
They have <Highlight variant="red">one skill:</Highlight> <Highlight variant="yellow">staying listed long enough to dilute shareholders.</Highlight>

The cycle is predictable because it's driven by <Highlight variant="blue">regulatory requirements:</Highlight>

1\. Company falls below $1.00 bid price (delisting risk)<br/>
2\. Company does reverse split to artificially raise price<br/>
3\. Reverse split reduces float (makes manipulation easier)<br/>
4\. Company/insiders pump the stock (lower float = less capital needed)<br/>
5\. After pump, company files offering/dilution (raising cash at inflated prices)<br/>
6\. Stock fades back down<br/>
7\. Cycle repeats<br/>

  </AlertDescription>
</Alert>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Your job:</Highlight>** Position yourself before the pump (Long setup) and after the pump when dilution begins (Short setup).

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Warning:</Highlight>** These are extreme-risk setups with unpredictable timing. They're not for beginners.
They require understanding listing requirements, tracking reverse splits, anticipating moves before confirmation,
and managing positions with no clear timeframe. But when they work, they offer some of the highest risk/reward ratios in small-cap trading.

## Understanding the Foundation: Why Reverse Splits Happen

Before you can trade these setups, you need to understand why companies do reverse splits and what happens afterward.

### <Highlight variant="accent">The Listing Requirements Problem</Highlight>

Both Nasdaq and NYSE have continued listing requirements that companies must maintain or face delisting:

**<Highlight variant="yellow">1\. Minimum Bid Price: $1.00</Highlight>**

This is the primary driver of reverse splits.

→ If a stock trades below $1.00 for 30 consecutive days, it receives a deficiency notice<br/>
→ Company has 180 days to regain compliance (close above $1.00 for 10 consecutive days)<br/>
→ If it fails, delisting proceedings begin<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Why it matters:</Highlight>**

→ Delisting = death sentence (moves to OTC markets, loses liquidity, institutional holders exit)<br/>
→ Companies will do ANYTHING to avoid this<br/>
→ Reverse split = fastest way to artificially boost price above $1.00 <br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">2\. Stockholders' Equity / Financial Health</Highlight>**

Companies must meet at least ONE of these tests:

→ Stockholders' equity above $2.5M (Nasdaq Capital Market)<br/>
→ Market value of listed securities above threshold<br/>
→ Positive net income from continuing operations

**<Highlight variant="blue">Why it matters:</Highlight>**

→ After reverse split raises price, company needs to raise cash<br/>
→ Offering/dilution at inflated prices improves stockholders' equity<br/>
→ This is why the pump → dilution cycle is GUARANTEED <br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">3\. Market Value and Public Float</Highlight>**

→ Minimum 400-500 publicly held shareholders<br/>
→ Minimum publicly held shares (500K+)<br/>
→ Minimum market value of public float ($1M-$15M depending on tier)<br/>
→ At least 2 registered market makers (Nasdaq) <br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">4\. SEC Reporting and Governance</Highlight>**

→ Maintain effective SEC registration<br/>
→ Timely filing of required reports (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K)<br/>
→ Independent audit committee<br/>
→ Board independence standards<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">The Reality:</Highlight>**<br/>
Companies doing reverse splits are barely hanging on. They're failing on MULTIPLE requirements, not just price.
The reverse split is a desperation move to buy time.

## What Happens During a Reverse Split

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Example:</Highlight> 1-for-10 Reverse Split**

**<Highlight variant="blue">Before Split:</Highlight>**

→ Price: $0.50<br/>
→ Shares outstanding: 100M<br/>
→ Float: 30M<br/>
→ Your position: 10,000 shares worth $5,000<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">After Split:</Highlight>**

→ Price: $5.00 (artificially 10x higher)<br/>
→ Shares outstanding: 10M (reduced 10x)<br/>
→ Float: 3M (reduced 10x)<br/>
→ Your position: 1,000 shares still worth $5,000<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Critical Insight:</Highlight>**

→ The price is artificially higher, but the float is MUCH smaller<br/>
→ A 3M float can be manipulated with far less volume/capital than a 30M float<br/>
→ This is WHY the pump happens — it's easier to move<br/>

## The Reverse Split Long: Anticipating the Pump

**<Highlight variant="blue">Box State Analysis:</Highlight>**<br/>
The Reverse Split Long trades the anticipation of artificial momentum created by the company's need to stay listed
and the reduced float making manipulation easier.

**<Highlight variant="accent">Phase 1: Pre-Reverse Split</Highlight>**

→ Company trading below $1.00 for weeks/months<br/>
→ Receives deficiency notice<br/>
→ Announces reverse split (usually 1-for-5, 1-for-10, 1-for-20)<br/>
→ Box State: Dead stock, no liquidity, no attention<br/>

**<Highlight variant="accent">Phase 2: Reverse Split Effective</Highlight>**

→ Split goes into effect<br/>
→ Price artificially jumps (e.g., $0.40 → $4.00 on 1-for-10)<br/>
→ Float reduces dramatically (e.g., 50M → 5M)<br/>
→ Box State: Clean slate, low float, easy to manipulate<br/>

**<Highlight variant="accent">Phase 3: The Waiting Period (0-14 Days)</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="blue">THIS IS WHERE THE SETUP FORMS</Highlight>**<br/>
→ Stock either:<br/>
→ Consolidates in a range<br/>
→ Fades slowly downward<br/>
→ Sits flat with no volume<br/>
→ Timing is UNPREDICTABLE (can pump same day or 2 weeks later)<br/>
→ Box State: Compression building (company preparing to pump)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="accent">Phase 4: The Pump</Highlight>**

→ Suddenly, volume surges<br/>
→ Price explodes upward (50-300% moves common)<br/>
→ Low float makes moves easy (minimal capital needed)<br/>
→ Box State: Parabolic expansion on minimal volume<br/>
→ This is your target — the move you're anticipating<br/>

### <Highlight variant="accent">Setup Overview</Highlight>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Category:</Highlight>** Manipulation/Anticipation<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Direction:</Highlight>** Long<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Complementary Setup:</Highlight>** Reverse Split Short<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Time of Day:</Highlight>** ANY (move can happen during any session)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Ideal Timeframe:</Highlight>** Daily tracking, intraday entry on 5-15 minute<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Risk Level:</Highlight>** EXTREME (★★★★★)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Average Success Rate:</Highlight>** 50-65% (timing uncertainty lowers probability)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Average Risk/Reward:</Highlight>** 1:3 to 1:10+ (when it works, it works big)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Volume Requirement:</Highlight>** ANTICIPATION trade (enter BEFORE volume surge)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Float Preference:</Highlight>** &lt;3M REQUIRED (lower = better)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Required Catalyst:</Highlight>** Reverse split (fresh within 0-14 days)<br/>

## Tracking Reverse Splits: The Preparation Phase

You can't trade this setup without tracking reverse splits. Here's how:

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Step 1: Find Reverse Split Announcements</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="blue">Sources:</Highlight>**

→ SEC EDGAR: Search for 8-K filings mentioning "reverse split" or "reverse stock split"<br/>
→ Nasdaq/NYSE Notices: Deficiency notices and compliance actions<br/>
→ Stock Screeners: Filter for recent reverse splits<br/>
→ Scanners: Real-time reverse split tracking services<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">What to Look For:</Highlight>**

→ Announcement date<br/>
→ Effective date (when split happens)<br/>
→ Split ratio (1-for-10, 1-for-20, etc.)<br/>
→ Post-split float (MUST be &lt;3M ideally)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Step 2: Post-Split Float Calculation</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="blue">Example:</Highlight>**

→ Pre-split float: 50M<br/>
→ Split ratio: 1-for-20<br/>
→ Post-split float: 50M / 20 = 2.5M<br/>
→ This is PERFECT (&lt;3M float)<br/>

If post-split float is >5M, skip it (not easy enough to pump)<br/>

<FloatCalculator />

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Step 3: Set Alerts</Highlight>**

Once you identify a candidate:

→ Price alerts: Above key resistance levels<br/>
→ Volume alerts: >3x average volume<br/>
→ Daily monitoring: Check daily chart every morning<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">The Reality:</Highlight>**<br/>
You're tracking 5-10 reverse split tickers at any time, waiting for ONE to set up properly.

## The Three Entry Strategies

**<Highlight variant="accent">Entry 1: The Consolidation Entry (Preferred)</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="blue">Setup:</Highlight>**

→ Reverse split effective 2-7 days ago<br/>
→ Stock has consolidated in a tight range<br/>
→ No major volume yet (pump hasn't started)<br/>
→ Clear support level formed<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Execution:</Highlight>**

→ Reverse split: Stock at $4.00 post-split<br/>
→ Days 1-5: Consolidates between $3.50-$4.20<br/>
→ You enter at $3.80 during consolidation<br/>
→ Stop loss: $3.30 (below consolidation low)<br/>
→ Risk: $0.50 per share<br/>
→ Target: $6.00-$8.00+ (1:4 to 1:8 R/R)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Why It Works:</Highlight>**<br/>

→ Consolidation = compression (energy building)<br/>
→ Clear stop level (below consolidation)<br/>
→ If breaks below, you're out with small loss<br/>
→ If pump starts, you're positioned early<br/>
→ Box State: Particles compressed in narrow range, waiting for catalyst<br/>

**<Highlight variant="accent">Entry 2: The Red Days Anticipation Entry</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="blue">Setup:</Highlight>**

→ Reverse split effective<br/>
→ Stock fades for 3-7 days (red candles)<br/>
→ Down 20-40% from post-split price<br/>
→ Oversold, but you know pump is coming eventually<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Execution:</Highlight>**

→ Reverse split: $5.00 post-split<br/>
→ Days 1-5: Fades to $3.00 (down 40%)<br/>
→ You enter small position at $3.00-$3.20<br/>
→ Stop loss: $2.50 (another 15-20% down)<br/>
→ Risk: $0.50-$0.70 per share<br/>
→ Target: $6.00-$10.00+ (1:5 to 1:10+ R/R)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Why It Works:</Highlight>**<br/>

→ Stock is oversold after split<br/>
→ Pump will come (company needs it)<br/>
→ You're getting better entry than consolidation buyers<br/>
→ More risk (timing more uncertain) but better R/R<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Caution:</Highlight>**<br/>

→ Use SMALL position size (25-50% normal)<br/>
→ Might continue fading for days before pump<br/>
→ Requires patience and conviction<br/>
→ Box State: Particles exhausted from selling, building oversold energy for reversal<br/>

**<Highlight variant="accent">Entry 3: The Volume Breakout Entry (Too Late)</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="blue">Setup:</Highlight>**

→ Wait for volume surge + breakout<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">The Problem:</Highlight>**<br/>

→ By the time volume confirms, move is often 30-50% done<br/>
→ These moves happen FAST (30-100% in 1-3 hours)<br/>
→ Waiting for confirmation = missing best entry<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Example:</Highlight>**

→ Reverse split ticker at $4.00<br/>
→ You wait for volume confirmation<br/>
→ Volume surges, price at $5.50 (already up 37%)<br/>
→ You enter at $5.50<br/>
→ Target: $8.00 (only 45% more upside)<br/>
→ You missed the meat of the move<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">The Lesson:</Highlight>**<br/>
This is an _<span style={{ color: "#fa3324" }}>ANTICIPATION setup, not a confirmation setup.</span>_ If you wait for volume, you're late.

<PatienceTrainer />

## Position Management: The Anticipation Hold

This is NOT an intraday scalp. You're holding for the pump, which could be:

→ Same day (rare)<br/>
→ 1-3 days (common)<br/>
→ 1-2 weeks (possible)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Management Framework:</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="blue">Days 1-3 After Entry:</Highlight>**

→ No major move yet (normal)<br/>
→ Hold position<br/>
→ Monitor daily for volume/price change<br/>
→ Don't panic if it chops or fades slightly<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Days 4-7:</Highlight>**

→ Still no move? Reassess<br/>
→ Check: Is consolidation still intact? Hold<br/>
→ Check: Breaking below stop? Exit<br/>
→ Check: New reverse split coming? (They can do another) Exit<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">When Pump Starts:</Highlight>**

→ Volume surges (5-10x average)<br/>
→ Price explodes upward<br/>
→ Take 30-50% profit at 1:2 R/R<br/>
→ Trail stop on remaining position<br/>
→ Target: 1:5-1:10 if momentum continues<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Exit Signals:</Highlight>**

→ Hits stop loss (consolidation breaks)<br/>
→ Parabolic exhaustion candle appears (Lesson 4)<br/>
→ Company files offering (Short setup activates)<br/>
→ 2 weeks pass with no move (cut and move on)<br/>

## Risk Management: Navigating Uncertainty

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Rule 1: Position Size = 25-50% of Normal</Highlight>**

→ Timing is unpredictable<br/>
→ Could fade before pumping<br/>
→ Could take 2 weeks to develop<br/>
→ Size for uncertainty<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Rule 2: Respect Your Stop</Highlight>**

→ Below consolidation low OR<br/>
→ Below recent support level<br/>
→ If broken, exit—pump might not come<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Rule 3: Don't Average Down</Highlight>**

→ If it's fading and you're underwater, don't add<br/>
→ This isn't a "conviction hold"<br/>
→ Cut if stop is hit<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Rule 4: Track Multiple Tickers</Highlight>**

→ Don't put all eggs in one reverse split<br/>
→ Track 3-5 at a time<br/>
→ One will likely set up while others fail<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Rule 5: Take Profits Fast</Highlight>**

→ When pump happens, don't get greedy<br/>
→ 1:3-1:5 is a WIN<br/>
→ These can reverse just as fast<br/>

<hr />

## The Reverse Split Short: Shorting the Dilution

**<Highlight variant="blue">Box State Analysis</Highlight>**

The Reverse Split Short trades the inevitable dilution that comes after the pump.

**<Highlight variant="accent">Phase 1: The Pump (Already Happened)</Highlight>**

→ Stock pumped 100-400% after reverse split<br/>
→ Company achieved goals (price >$1, improved market metrics)<br/>
→ Box State: Overextended, parabolic<br/>

**<Highlight variant="accent">Phase 2: The Offering Filing</Highlight>**

→ Company files S-1 or S-3 (offering registration)<br/>
→ OR: Direct offering announcement (8-K filing)<br/>
→ This is your signal—the short setup is activating<br/>

**<Highlight variant="accent">Phase 3: The Distribution Phase</Highlight>**

→ Company/insiders/underwriters selling shares<br/>
→ Price starts fading<br/>
→ Volume remains elevated (distribution)<br/>
→ Box State: Supply overwhelming demand, systematic selling<br/>

**<Highlight variant="accent">Phase 4: The Fade</Highlight>**

→ Stock gives back 50-80% of the pump<br/>
→ Returns toward pre-pump levels<br/>
→ This is your target<br/>

### <Highlight variant="accent">Setup Overview</Highlight>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Category:</Highlight>** Dilution/Distribution<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Direction:</Highlight>** Short<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Complementary Setup:</Highlight>** Reverse Split Long<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Time of Day:</Highlight>** ANY<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Ideal Timeframe:</Highlight>** Daily context, intraday entry on 5-15 minute<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Risk Level:</Highlight>** EXTREME (★★★★★)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Average Success Rate:</Highlight>** 55-70%<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Average Risk/Reward:</Highlight>** 1:2 to 1:5<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Volume Requirement:</Highlight>** High after pump (distribution phase)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Float Preference:</Highlight>** &lt;5M (same low-float tickers)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Required Catalyst:</Highlight>** Post-pump offering/dilution filing<br/>

## The Critical Challenge: Finding Short Locates

This is where most traders fail with this setup.

**<Highlight variant="yellow">The Problem:</Highlight>**

→ Float is &lt;3M (extremely low)<br/>
→ Stock just pumped 200% (high demand to short)<br/>
→ Short availability is SCARCE or NONEXISTENT<br/>
→ Borrow fees: Often $50-$200+ per day per 1,000 shares<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Example:</Highlight>**

→ You want to short 5,000 shares<br/>
→ Borrow fee: $100 per 1,000 shares per day<br/>
→ Daily cost: $500/day just to hold the position<br/>
→ If you hold 5 days: $2,500 in fees alone<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">The Reality:</Highlight>**

→ Most retail traders can't locate shares<br/>
→ If they can, fees eat into profits significantly<br/>
→ This setup is more theoretical than practical for most traders<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Who Can Trade This:</Highlight>**

→ Traders with access to hard-to-borrow desks<br/>
→ Prop firm traders with better locate access<br/>
→ Traders willing to pay extreme borrow fees<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">If You Can't Find Locates:</Highlight>**

→ Skip this setup entirely<br/>
→ Focus on the long side only<br/>
→ Or: Trade larger float dilution setups<br/>

## Entry Strategy: Post-Offering Fade

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Step 1: Identify the Offering</Highlight>**

→ Monitor SEC EDGAR for S-1/S-3 filings<br/>
→ Watch for 8-K announcements (direct offerings)<br/>
→ Set alerts for reverse split tickers you tracked<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Step 2: Confirm the Pump Has Occurred</Highlight>**

→ Stock must have already pumped (100-400%+)<br/>
→ Don't short before the pump (too early)<br/>
→ Don't short during the pump (squeeze risk)<br/>
→ Short AFTER offering is filed/announced<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Step 3: Entry Methods</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="blue">Method A: Offering Announcement Fade</Highlight>**

→ Offering announced<br/>
→ Stock gaps down or fades intraday<br/>
→ Enter short on the gap down or fade<br/>
→ Stop: Reclaim of previous day high<br/>
→ Target: 30-60% retracement of the pump<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Method B: Failed Bounce Short</Highlight>**

→ After offering, stock bounces (short covering)<br/>
→ Bounce fails at resistance (previous support level)<br/>
→ Enter short on rejection of resistance<br/>
→ Stop: Break above resistance<br/>
→ Target: Previous lows, then extensions<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Method C: VWAP Rejection Short</Highlight>**

→ After offering, price rejects VWAP<br/>
→ Enter short on VWAP rejection<br/>
→ Stop: Reclaim above VWAP<br/>
→ Target: Continued fade lower<br/>

## Position Management: Riding the Fade

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Day 1 (Offering Announced):</Highlight>**

→ Entry executed<br/>
→ Watch: Does it close below offering price?<br/>
→ If yes, hold<br/>
→ If no (closes above), tighten stop<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Days 2-5:</Highlight>**

→ Fade typically continues<br/>
→ Take 30-50% profit at 1:2 R/R<br/>
→ Trail stop on remaining position<br/>
→ Target: 50-70% retracement of pump<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Week 2+:</Highlight>**

→ If still fading, trail stops tightly<br/>
→ Watch for First Green Day bounce (Lesson 5)<br/>
→ Exit before relief bounce<br/>
→ Don't overstay—borrow fees add up<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Exit Signals:</Highlight>**

→ Hits profit target (1:2 to 1:4)<br/>
→ Strong green day (covering bounce)<br/>
→ Borrow fees too expensive (close position)<br/>
→ New catalyst (closes offering, new news)<br/>

<hr />

## Complementary Relationship: The Complete Cycle

Understanding BOTH setups allows you to trade the entire manipulation cycle.

**<Highlight variant="yellow">The Timeline:</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="blue">Week 0: Pre-Reverse Split</Highlight>**

→ Company below $1, receives deficiency notice<br/>
→ Announces reverse split<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Week 1: Reverse Split Effective</Highlight>**

→ Split goes into effect<br/>
→ Float reduced dramatically<br/>
→ START TRACKING FOR LONG SETUP<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Weeks 1-2: The Waiting Period</Highlight>**

→ Stock consolidates or fades<br/>
→ POSITION FOR LONG (anticipation)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Week 2-3: The Pump</Highlight>**

→ Volume surges, price explodes<br/>
→ HOLD LONG, TAKE PROFITS<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Week 3: Offering Filed</Highlight>**

→ Company files offering<br/>
→ LONG EXIT, SHORT ENTRY (if locates available)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Week 4-6: The Fade</Highlight>**

→ Stock gives back 50-80% of gains<br/>
→ HOLD SHORT, TAKE PROFITS<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Repeat:</Highlight>** Company may do another reverse split in 6-12 months

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Practice Drill:</Highlight>** Set up alerts for reverse split announcements.
Track 10 reverse split tickers over 3 months. Journal which ones pumped, when they pumped, and what the offering timing was.
Build pattern recognition for the cycle.

**<Highlight variant="accent">2\. Timing: Entering at the Right Moment</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="blue">For Reverse Split Long:</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="green">Best:</Highlight>** Consolidation entry (clear structure, defined risk)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Good:</Highlight>** Red days entry (oversold, better R/R, more risk)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="red">Avoid:</Highlight>** Volume breakout entry (too late, missed move)

**<Highlight variant="blue">For Reverse Split Short:</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="green">Best:</Highlight>** Offering announcement fade (immediate distribution signal)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Good:</Highlight>** Failed bounce after offering<br/>
**<Highlight variant="red">Avoid:</Highlight>** Shorting during the pump (squeeze risk)

**<Highlight variant="accent">3\. Risk Management: Defining and Controlling Loss</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Position Sizing (Long):</Highlight>**

→ Risk: 1% of account<br/>
→ Position size: 25-50% of normal (uncertainty factor)<br/>
→ Stop: Below consolidation low or support<br/>
→ Target: 1:5+ R/R<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Position Sizing (Short):</Highlight>**

→ Risk: 0.5-1% of account (factor in borrow fees)<br/>

## Final Thoughts: Trading Corporate Desperation

The Reverse Split setups are unique in this entire module because you're not trading market sentiment or technical patterns —
you're trading regulatory mechanics and corporate survival tactics.

**<Highlight variant="yellow">The Long setup requires:</Highlight>**

→ Patience to track reverse splits<br/>
→ Courage to enter with no volume confirmation<br/>
→ Discipline to size small (uncertainty factor)<br/>
→ Faith in the cycle (pump WILL come, but when?)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">The Short setup requires:</Highlight>**

→ Access to hard-to-borrow shares<br/>
→ Willingness to pay extreme borrow fees<br/>
→ Patience to wait for offering before shorting<br/>
→ Discipline to exit before fees eat profits<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Both setups trade the inevitable cycle:</Highlight>**

1\. Company desperate (below $1)<br/>
2\. Reverse split (artificial price boost)<br/>
3\. Pump (taking advantage of low float)<br/>
4\. Offering (dilution at inflated prices)<br/>
5\. Fade (back toward reality)<br/>

The cycle repeats because these companies have no real business.
They're zombies, existing only to dilute shareholders and stay listed another quarter.

The traders who master these setups share one trait: They understand this isn't about technicals or sentiment —
it's about regulatory requirements and manipulation mechanics. They track the splits, anticipate the moves, and execute without emotion.

These setups aren't for everyone. If you can't track reverse splits, position without confirmation, or access short locates, skip them.
But if you can, they offer explosive asymmetric risk/reward based on predictable cycles.
