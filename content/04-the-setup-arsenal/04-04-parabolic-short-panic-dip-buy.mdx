## Trading Extreme Momentum Reversals — The Account Makers and Account Breakers

### <Highlight variant="accent">The Edge of Chaos</Highlight>

We've reached the most dangerous territory in day trading: <Highlight variant="red">extreme momentum reversals</Highlight>.

Everything you've learned so far — Opening Range Breakouts, Afternoon Consolidations Breakouts, Gap Up Shorts — these all involve reading structure,
waiting for confirmation, managing risk systematically. They're disciplined, methodical setups.

The <Highlight variant="yellow">Parabolic Short</Highlight> and <Highlight variant="yellow">Panic Dip Buy</Highlight> are different.

These setups occur at <Highlight variant="yellow">moments of maximum market chaos</Highlight> — when price is moving so violently that most traders freeze,
when emotions override logic, when fortunes are made and destroyed in minutes. These are the setups that create legendary trading stories...
and spectacular account blow-ups.

The Parabolic Short attempts to catch the exact moment when an explosive upward move exhausts and reverses.
You're shorting into a freight train, waiting for it to derail.

The Panic Dip Buy attempts to catch the exact moment when a panic cascade exhausts and bounces. You're catching a falling knife, hoping it's the bottom.

Both setups have success rates barely above 50%. Both can result in catastrophic losses if mishandled.
Both require ice-cold execution under maximum pressure. And both — when executed correctly — <Highlight variant="green">offer some of the highest risk/reward ratios in day trading</Highlight>.

By the end of this lesson, you'll understand:

→ How to recognize these extreme moves using the Market Magic Box<br/>
→ When to enter (and when to stay the hell away)<br/>
→ How to manage the extreme risk inherent in these trades<br/>
→ Why these setups can build or destroy trading accounts<br/>

**<Highlight variant="red">Warning:</Highlight>** If you're new to trading, skip these setups entirely.
Master everything else in this module first. These are advanced, high-risk plays reserved for traders with strong risk management and emotional control.

## The Parabolic Short: Shorting the Exhaustion

### <Highlight variant="accent">Box State Analysis</Highlight>

A parabolic move is the Market Magic Box in maximum energy expansion state. Here's what's happening at the particle level:

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Phase 1:</Highlight>** Acceleration Begins

→ Catalyst triggers buying (breakout, news, squeeze)<br/>
→ Particles (buyers) enter with increasing velocity<br/>
→ Each candle is larger than the last<br/>
→ Volume is expanding with each wave higher<br/>
→ Price is moving away from all moving averages and VWAP<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Phase 2:</Highlight>** Parabolic Acceleration

→ Buying becomes frenzied, almost vertical<br/>
→ Candles are getting bigger and bigger (1-minute candles showing $0.50-$2.00 moves)<br/>
→ Volume bars are massive and increasing<br/>
→ Level 2 tape is scrolling at extreme speed<br/>
→ This is when most traders think: "I should short this!"<br/>
→ **<Highlight variant="red">THIS IS THE TRAP. DO NOT SHORT YET.</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Phase 3:</Highlight>** Exhaustion Signal

→ Suddenly, a candle forms with a massive upper wick (rejection)<br/>
→ Or: buying velocity slows visibly (candles getting smaller)<br/>
→ Or: volume on the next push is lower than previous (divergence)<br/>
→ This is the exhaustion candle—the first crack in the momentum<br/>
→ Particles that were accelerating upward suddenly decelerate<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Phase 4:</Highlight>** The Reversal

→ Price breaks below the low of the exhaustion candle<br/>
→ Sellers overwhelm buyers<br/>
→ Panic spreads through late longs (they're trapped at the top)<br/>
→ Mean reversion begins—price snaps back toward VWAP/EMA like an elastic<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Box State Summary:</Highlight>**

→ Expansion → Maximum Extension → Exhaustion → Reversion<br/>
→ You're trading the moment particles lose upward velocity and reverse<br/>

### <Highlight variant="accent">Setup Overview</Highlight>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Category:</Highlight>** Mean Reversion/Exhaustion<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Direction:</Highlight>** Short<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Complementary Setup:</Highlight>** Panic Dip Buy (Long)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Time of Day:</Highlight>** 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM EST (AVOID pre-market and after-hours)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Ideal Timeframe:</Highlight>** Entry on 1-5 minute, Exit on 5-15 minute<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Risk Level:</Highlight>** EXTREME (★★★★★)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Average Success Rate:</Highlight>** 50-65% (highly skill-dependent)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Average Risk/Reward:</Highlight>** 1:2 to 1:4+ (when it works, it works fast)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Volume Requirement:</Highlight>** MASSIVE and increasing during the parabolic phase<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Float Preference:</Highlight>** Any (lower float = higher risk due to squeeze potential)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Required Catalyst:</Highlight>** Variable — can occur after breakouts, consolidations, or spontaneously<br/>

## The Four Timing Windows for Parabolic Moves

Parabolic moves can occur at different times during the trading day, each with different risk profiles:

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Window 1:</Highlight>** Morning Squeeze (9:30 - 11:00 AM)

**<Highlight variant="blue">Context:</Highlight>**

→ Opening Range Breakout turns parabolic<br/>
→ News catalyst creates explosive momentum<br/>
→ Shorts get trapped and cover aggressively<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Characteristics:</Highlight>**

→ Highest volume window<br/>
→ Circuit breakers/halts protect you (stock halts on 10% moves)<br/>
→ Easier to exit if wrong<br/>
→ Most traders watching (liquidity present)<br/>
→ Risk Level: Medium-High (safer than other windows)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">When It Forms:</Highlight>**

→ After clean consolidation break (see Lesson 2: ORB)<br/>
→ After News Play momentum continues (see Lesson 1)<br/>
→ Short squeeze on high short interest ticker<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Window 2:</Highlight>** Midday Surprise (11:00 AM - 2:00 PM)

**<Highlight variant="blue">Context:</Highlight>**

→ Unexpected move during low-volume period<br/>
→ Can be news-driven or purely technical<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Characteristics:</Highlight>**

→ Lower volume = less liquidity<br/>
→ Harder to exit positions<br/>
→ More whipsaw potential<br/>
→ Risk Level: High (less predictable)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">When to Engage:</Highlight>** Only if volume is still strong and pattern is crystal clear

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Window 3:</Highlight>** Afternoon Explosion (2:00 - 4:00 PM)

**<Highlight variant="blue">Context:</Highlight>**

→ Afternoon Breakout setup (Lesson 3) goes parabolic<br/>
→ Power hour brings volume back<br/>
→ Shorts trapped from consolidation panic<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Characteristics:</Highlight>**

→ Volume returns<br/>
→ Halts still exist<br/>
→ But approaching close = time pressure<br/>
→ Risk Level: Medium-High<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Critical:</Highlight>** Must manage before 3:45 PM to avoid after-hours risk

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Window 4:</Highlight>** Pre-Market / After-Hours (AVOID)

**<Highlight variant="blue">Context:</Highlight>**

→ No circuit breakers<br/>
→ Thin liquidity<br/>
→ Can move 100-500% with no halts<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Characteristics:</Highlight>**

→ ACCOUNT KILLER ZONE<br/>
→ No protection from halts<br/>
→ Stop losses can be gapped through by 100%+<br/>
→ Impossible to exit on manipulation<br/>
→ Risk Level: SUICIDAL<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Rule:</Highlight>** **<Highlight variant="red">NEVER short parabolic moves in pre-market or after-hours, period.</Highlight>**

## The Golden Rule: Never Step in Front of the Move

This is the #1 mistake that blows up accounts on this setup:<br/>
_<span style={{ color: '#faf0aa' }}>"The stock is up 100% already, it HAS to come down!"</span>_

No. It doesn't. It can go up another 100%. Then another 50%. Then halt up. Then open another 80% higher.<br/>
The frontside of a parabolic move goes HIGHER and FURTHER than rational thinking suggests.

Examples of "Impossible" Parabolic Moves:

→ Stock at $5.00 in pre-market<br/>
→ Opens at $8.00 (up 60%)<br/>
→ Traders: "That's it, I'm shorting!"<br/>
→ Stock goes to $12.00 (up 140% total)<br/>
→ Traders: "Okay, NOW it's done!"<br/>
→ Stock goes to $18.00 (up 260% total)<br/>
→ Stock halts at $22.00 (up 340% total)<br/>
→ Finally reverses to $15.00

The shorts who entered at $8.00 are dead. The shorts who entered at $12.00 are crippled.<br/>
Only the shorts who waited for exhaustion at $22.00 survived and profited.

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Your Job:</Highlight>** Wait. Watch. Be patient. Let the move complete. Then strike when exhaustion appears.

## Identifying the Exhaustion Candle: Your Entry Signal

The exhaustion candle is THE critical signal. Here's how to identify it:

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Signal 1:</Highlight>** The Rejection Wick (Most Reliable)

**<Highlight variant="blue">What It Looks Like:</Highlight>**

→ A 1-min or 5-min candle with a long upper wick (2-3x the body size)<br/>
→ Price spiked to a new high but immediately rejected<br/>
→ Volume on this candle is massive (often the highest of the move)<br/>
→ Closes near or below its open<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">What It Means:</Highlight>**

→ Buyers pushed price up one last time<br/>
→ Sellers overwhelmed them at the top<br/>
→ No one wants to buy at these prices anymore<br/>
→ This is exhaustion<br/>
→ **<Highlight variant="green">Entry:</Highlight>** Break of the low of this candle

**<Highlight variant="blue">Box State:</Highlight>** Particles reached maximum extension, hit resistance (lack of buyers), and reversed direction.

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Signal 2:</Highlight>** Volume Divergence (Early Warning)

**<Highlight variant="blue">What It Looks Like:</Highlight>**

→ Previous candle: Up $1.00 on 500K volume<br/>
→ Next candle: Up $0.50 on 300K volume
→ Price is still going up, but with less volume

**<Highlight variant="blue">What It Means:</Highlight>**

→ Buying pressure is weakening<br/>
→ Momentum is fading<br/>
→ Exhaustion is approaching<br/>
→ **<Highlight variant="green">Entry:</Highlight>** Don't enter yet, but prepare. Wait for rejection wick or candle size decrease.

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Signal 3:</Highlight>** Candle Size Decrease (Velocity Drop)

**<Highlight variant="blue">What It Looks Like:</Highlight>**

→ Previous 5 candles: $0.50, $0.70, $1.00, $1.20, $1.50 moves<br/>
→ Next candle: $0.30 move<br/>
→ Acceleration is slowing<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">What It Means:</Highlight>**

→ Velocity is decreasing<br/>
→ Particles are losing upward momentum<br/>
→ Exhaustion is imminent<br/>
→ **<Highlight variant="green">Entry:</Highlight>** Wait for confirmation (rejection wick or break of recent low).

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Signal 4:</Highlight>** Level 2 Tape Slowdown (Advanced)

**<Highlight variant="blue">What You See:</Highlight>**

→ Tape was scrolling at insane speed during acceleration<br/>
→ Suddenly, it slows down<br/>
→ Offers (sellers) start stacking up on Level 2<br/>
→ Bids (buyers) thin out

**<Highlight variant="blue">What It Means:</Highlight>**

→ Buying pressure exhausted<br/>
→ Sellers arriving<br/>
→ Reversal incoming<br/>
→ **<Highlight variant="green">Entry:</Highlight>** Combined with other signals, this confirms timing

<AnatomyOfTheTurn />

## Entry Strategies: Aggressive vs. Safe

**<Highlight variant="accent">Approach 1:</Highlight>** The Exhaustion Wick Entry (Aggressive)

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Entry Point:</Highlight>** Break of exhaustion candle low<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Advantages:</Highlight>** Earliest entry, best R/R<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Risks:</Highlight>** Might be a fake-out, move could continue

**<Highlight variant="blue">Execution:</Highlight>**

→ Parabolic move from $10 to $15<br/>
→ 1-min candle spikes to $15.80, rejects, closes at $15.20 (big wick)<br/>
→ Volume on this candle: 800K (highest of the move)<br/>
→ Enter short on break of $15.20<br/>
→ Stop loss: Above $15.80 (above the wick high)<br/>
→ Risk: $0.60 per share<br/>
→ Target: Reversion to $14.00 (VWAP or moving average)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">When to Use:</Highlight>**

→ Exhaustion signal is crystal clear (massive wick)<br/>
→ Volume confirms (highest volume of the move)<br/>
→ You're experienced with this setup<br/>
→ You can handle being wrong quickly

**<Highlight variant="accent">Approach 2:</Highlight>** The Confirmation Entry (Safe)

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Entry Point:</Highlight>** Second candle confirms reversal<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Advantages:</Highlight>** Higher probability, confirmation present<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Risks:</Highlight>** Worse entry price, smaller R/R

**<Highlight variant="blue">Execution:</Highlight>**

→ First candle: Exhaustion wick at $15.80<br/>
→ Second candle: Closes below first candle low ($15.00)<br/>
→ This confirms the reversal is real<br/>
→ Enter short on close of second candle or break of $15.00<br/>
→ Stop loss: Above $15.80<br/>
→ Risk: $0.80 per share<br/>
→ Target: Reversion to $13.50-$14.00<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">When to Use:</Highlight>**

→ You want higher probability<br/>
→ Managing larger position size<br/>
→ Still learning this setup<br/>
→ Recent market conditions have been choppy

**<Highlight variant="accent">Approach 3:</Highlight>** The Moving Average Break Entry (Conservative)

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Entry Point:</Highlight>** Price breaks key moving average (20EMA or 50EMA)
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Advantages:</Highlight>** Clear technical level, highest probability
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Risks:</Highlight>** Late entry, significant portion of move missed

**<Highlight variant="blue">Execution:</Highlight>**

→ Parabolic move to $16.00<br/>
→ Exhaustion wick appears<br/>
→ Price starts fading<br/>
→ 20EMA is at $14.00<br/>
→ Price breaks $14.00 with volume<br/>
→ Enter short on break of 20EMA<br/>
→ Stop loss: Reclaim above 20EMA<br/>
→ Target: VWAP or further support

**<Highlight variant="yellow">When to Use:</Highlight>**

→ You're conservative with risk<br/>
→ You want maximum confirmation<br/>
→ You're newer to this setup<br/>

## Position Management: Fast In, Fast Out

Parabolic shorts are speed trades. The reversion happens fast, and you need to take profits aggressively.

**<Highlight variant="blue">Management Framework:</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Entry to First 2-5 Minutes:</Highlight>**

→ Is the reversal confirming immediately?<br/>
→ YES: Hold, watch for acceleration down<br/>
→ NO: Tighten stop to break-even, be ready to exit

**<Highlight variant="yellow">First Support Level (Usually VWAP or Volume Node):</Highlight>**

→ Take 50-70% profit<br/>
→ Do not get greedy<br/>
→ Move stop to break-even on remaining position

**<Highlight variant="yellow">If It Keeps Fading:</Highlight>**

→ Trail stop using 5-min structure<br/>
→ Watch for bounce (shorts covering)<br/>
→ Target: Moving averages, pre-parabolic levels<br/>
→ Exit on volume spike (capitulation/bounce signal)

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Maximum Hold Time:</Highlight>**

→ 15-30 minutes typically<br/>
→ Reversions happen fast or not at all<br/>
→ If it's not working in 10 minutes, exit

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Red Flags to Exit Immediately:</Highlight>**

→ Price reclaims exhaustion candle high<br/>
→ Volume surges on an upward move (squeeze resuming)<br/>
→ New high is made (you were wrong, cut it)

## Risk Management: The Account Saver

This setup will destroy your account if you don't respect these rules:

**<Highlight variant="accent">Rule 1: Position Size = 25% of Normal (Maximum)</Highlight>**

→ If you normally trade 1,000 shares, trade 250<br/>
→ This is the highest-risk setup in the module<br/>
→ One bad trade can wipe out weeks of gains

**<Highlight variant="accent">Rule 2: Hard Stops Always, Zero Negotiation</Highlight>**

→ Stop is above exhaustion candle high<br/>
→ If it's hit, you're out immediately<br/>
→ No "let me see if it comes back"<br/>
→ No averaging into the position

**<Highlight variant="accent">Rule 3: Never Short Pre-Market or After-Hours</Highlight>**

→ THIS WILL KILL YOUR ACCOUNT<br/>
→ No circuit breakers = infinite squeeze potential<br/>
→ You can be up $500, then down $5,000 in 2 minutes<br/>
→ There is no edge in PM/AH parabolic shorts

**<Highlight variant="accent">Rule 4: Never Short Against News</Highlight>**

→ If FDA approval just hit, don't short the parabolic<br/>
→ If major partnership announced, don't short<br/>
→ Material news can create multi-day parabolic moves<br/>
→ You'll be on the wrong side of a freight train

**<Highlight variant="accent">Rule 5: Take Profits Fast</Highlight>**

→ Don't hold for home runs<br/>
→ 1.5R-2R = take it and run<br/>
→ Reversions can reverse back up just as fast<br/>
→ Lock in the win, move on

## The Panic Dip Buy: Catching the Falling Knife (Carefully)

### Box State Analysis

A panic selloff is the Market Magic Box in maximum energy contraction/cascade state. Here's what's happening:

**<Highlight variant="accent">Phase 1: The Breakdown</Highlight>**

→ Catalyst triggers selling (bad news, failed breakout, sector weakness)<br/>
→ Particles (holders) start exiting with increasing velocity<br/>
→ Red candles cascade downward<br/>
→ Volume increasing on each wave lower

**<Highlight variant="accent">Phase 2: The Panic Cascade</Highlight>**

→ Selling becomes violent, almost vertical drop<br/>
→ Red candles are getting bigger and bigger<br/>
→ Volume bars are massive and increasing<br/>
→ Holders are capitulating: "Just get me out at any price!"<br/>
→ Stop losses trigger, creating more selling<br/>
→ This is when most traders think: _<span style={{ color: '#faf0aa' }}>"I should buy this dip!"</span>_<br/>
→ <Highlight variant="red">THIS IS THE TRAP. DO NOT BUY YET.</Highlight>

**<Highlight variant="accent">Phase 3: The Washout (Climax Volume)</Highlight>**

→ Suddenly, a candle forms with MASSIVE volume (2-5x previous candles)<br/>
→ Price makes a final low, then closes higher (long lower wick)<br/>
→ This is capitulation — the last holders giving up<br/>
→ This is the washout candle — the signal that panic is exhausted

<PanicVolumeVisualizer />

**<Highlight variant="accent">Phase 4: The Bounce</Highlight>**

→ Shorts start covering (they're up big, time to take profits)<br/>
→ Bargain hunters step in (oversold bounce)<br/>
→ Mean reversion begins — price snaps back toward VWAP like a bungee cord

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Box State Summary:</Highlight>**

→ Contraction → Maximum Cascade → Capitulation → Reversion<br/>
→ You're trading the moment downward velocity exhausts and reverses

### <Highlight variant="accent">Setup Overview</Highlight>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Category:</Highlight>** Reversal/Mean Reversion<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Direction:</Highlight>** Long<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Complementary Setup:</Highlight>** Parabolic Short<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Time of Day:</Highlight>** 9:30 AM - 11:00 AM EST (OR during multi-day selloff)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Ideal Timeframe:</Highlight>** Entry on 5-minute, Exit on 5-30 minute<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Risk Level:</Highlight>** EXTREME (★★★★★)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Average Success Rate:</Highlight>** 45-60% (lower than parabolic short)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Average Risk/Reward:</Highlight>** 1:2 to 1:5+ (dead cat bounce vs. real reversal)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Volume Requirement:</Highlight>** CLIMAX volume on washout candle<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Float Preference:</Highlight>** Any (lower float = more volatile bounces)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Required Catalyst:</Highlight>** Context-dependent (multi-day runner exhaustion OR PM strength to open washout)<br/>

## The Two Contexts for Panic Dip Buys

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Context 1:</Highlight>** The Multi-Day Runner Selloff

**<Highlight variant="blue">The Setup:</Highlight>**

→ Stock has run 400-800% over 4-6 days<br/>
→ Becomes the "stock of the week"<br/>
→ Everyone knows about it, retail is piling in<br/>
→ Day 5 or 6: Massive red day<br/>
→ Stock drops 40-60% in a single session<br/>
→ Panic selling: "The party is over!"

**<Highlight variant="blue">What's Actually Happening:</Highlight>**

→ Early buyers (Day 1-2) are taking profits<br/>
→ Late buyers (Day 4-5) are panicking<br/>
→ Market makers distributing<br/>
→ Shorts piling in aggressively

**<Highlight variant="blue">The Trade:</Highlight>**

→ Wait for climax volume washout (usually 10:00-11:00 AM)<br/>
→ Enter on first green reversal candle<br/>
→ Target: Bounce back to VWAP or 20-30% retracement<br/>
→ This is often a "dead cat bounce"—take profits fast<br/>
→ Risk: Stock might continue falling for days (the run is truly over)

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Context 2:</Highlight>** The Pre-Market Strength → Open Washout

**<Highlight variant="blue">The Setup:</Highlight>**

→ Stock has strong pre-market momentum (news catalyst)<br/>
→ Gaps up 30-80% in pre-market<br/>
→ Opens at 9:30 AM strong<br/>
→ Within first 30 minutes: Violent washout<br/>
→ All the PM gains evaporate<br/>
→ Panic selling as PM buyers trapped

**<Highlight variant="blue">What's Actually Happening:</Highlight>**

→ Early PM buyers getting stopped out<br/>
→ Profit-takers from PM selling aggressively<br/>
→ Weak hands shaken out<br/>
→ Shorts attacking the failed breakout

**<Highlight variant="blue">The Trade:</Highlight>**

→ Wait for climax volume washout (usually 9:45-10:15 AM)<br/>
→ Enter on first green reversal candle<br/>
→ Target: Reversion back to VWAP or PM levels<br/>
→ This can be a real reversal if catalyst is strong<br/>
→ Risk: Washout might be the start of a full fade (becomes Gap Up Short instead)

## Identifying the Washout Candle: Your Entry Signal

The washout/capitulation candle is THE critical signal. Here's how to identify it:

**<Highlight variant="accent">Signal 1:</Highlight>** Climax Volume (Most Important)

**<Highlight variant="blue">What It Looks Like:</Highlight>**

→ Previous candles: 200K, 350K, 500K volume (increasing)<br/>
→ Washout candle: 1.2M volume (2-3x previous)<br/>
→ This is the panic spike—everyone selling at once

**<Highlight variant="blue">What It Means:</Highlight>**

→ Maximum fear<br/>
→ Capitulation in progress<br/>
→ Weak hands being washed out<br/>
→ This is where the panic exhausts<br/>
→ Entry: Wait for this candle to close, then enter on first green candle

**<Highlight variant="accent">Signal 2:</Highlight>** Long Lower Wick (Rejection of Low)

**<Highlight variant="blue">What It Looks Like:</Highlight>**

→ Candle drops to $6.50 (new low)<br/>
→ Immediately reverses back up<br/>
→ Closes at $7.20 (well above the low)<br/>
→ Long lower wick shows rejection

**<Highlight variant="blue">What It Means:</Highlight>**

→ Sellers exhausted at the low<br/>
→ Buyers stepped in aggressively<br/>
→ Support found<br/>
→ Bounce beginning<br/>
→ Entry: On close of this candle or break above its high

**<Highlight variant="accent">Signal 3:</Highlight>** Green Reversal Candle After Washout

**<Highlight variant="blue">What It Looks Like:</Highlight>**

→ Washout candle: Red, closes at $7.00<br/>
→ Next candle: Green, closes at $7.50 (50 cents higher)<br/>
→ First green candle after climax volume

**<Highlight variant="blue">What It Means:</Highlight>**

→ Momentum shifting<br/>
→ Shorts taking profits (covering = buying)<br/>
→ Dip buyers stepping in<br/>
→ Bounce confirmed<br/>
→ Entry: On close of first green candle or break of its high

## Entry Strategies: Patient vs. Aggressive

**<Highlight variant="accent">Approach 1: The First Green Candle Entry (Aggressive)</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Entry Point:</Highlight>** Close of first green reversal candle after washout<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Advantages:</Highlight>** Earliest entry, best R/R<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Risks:</Highlight>** Could be a fake bounce, might drop more

**<Highlight variant="blue">Execution:</Highlight>**

→ Stock washout from $10.00 to $7.00<br/>
→ Climax volume: 1.5M on the washout candle<br/>
→ Next candle: Green, closes at $7.60 (+$0.60)<br/>
→ Enter long at close of green candle ($7.60)<br/>
→ Stop loss: Below washout low ($6.90)<br/>
→ Risk: $0.70 per share<br/>
→ Target: VWAP at $9.00, then $9.50-$10.00

**<Highlight variant="blue">When to Use:</Highlight>**

→ Climax volume is undeniable (3x+ normal)<br/>
→ Context supports bounce (strong catalyst OR multi-day runner)<br/>
→ You're experienced with this setup

**<Highlight variant="accent">Approach 2: The VWAP Test Entry (Confirmation)</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Entry Point:</Highlight>** After bounce tests and holds VWAP<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Advantages:</Highlight>** Confirmation that bounce is real<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Risks:</Highlight>** Worse entry, smaller R/R

**<Highlight variant="blue">Execution:</Highlight>**

→ Washout to $7.00<br/>
→ Bounces to $8.50 (VWAP)<br/>
→ Tests VWAP, holds, bounces again<br/>
→ Enter on successful VWAP hold<br/>
→ Stop loss: Break below VWAP<br/>
→ Target: Previous highs or resistance

**<Highlight variant="blue">When to Use:</Highlight>**

→ You want confirmation<br/>
→ Washout was messy (not crystal clear)<br/>
→ You're conservative with risk

**<Highlight variant="accent">Approach 3: The Higher Low Entry (Conservative)</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Entry Point:</Highlight>** After first bounce completes and makes a higher low<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Advantages:</Highlight>** Maximum confirmation, trend establishing<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Risks:</Highlight>** Late entry, much smaller R/R

**<Highlight variant="blue">Execution:</Highlight>**

→ Washout low: $7.00<br/>
→ Bounces to $8.50<br/>
→ Pulls back to $7.80 (higher low than $7.00)<br/>
→ Holds and bounces again<br/>
→ Enter on the second bounce<br/>
→ Stop loss: Break of $7.80 (the higher low)<br/>
→ Target: $9.00+

**<Highlight variant="blue">When to Use:</Highlight>**

→ You're very conservative<br/>
→ Learning this setup<br/>
→ Managing larger size

## Position Management: Take Profits Fast

Panic dip buys are scalp trades, not swing trades. The bounce can be violent but short-lived.

**<Highlight variant="blue">Management Framework:</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Entry to First 10-15 Minutes:</Highlight>**

→ Is the bounce confirming immediately?<br/>
→ YES: Hold, trail stop using 5-min lows<br/>
→ NO: Tighten stop to break-even, consider exiting

**<Highlight variant="yellow">First Resistance (Usually VWAP):</Highlight>**

→ Take 50-70% profit<br/>
→ This is critical—most bounces stall at VWAP<br/>
→ Move stop to break-even on remaining

**<Highlight variant="yellow">If It Continues:</Highlight>**

→ Trail stop aggressively<br/>
→ Watch for rejection at moving averages or previous highs<br/>
→ Target: 30-50% retracement of the drop<br/>
→ Exit on first sign of weakness (volume declining, lower high forming)

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Maximum Hold Time:</Highlight>**

→ 30-60 minutes typically<br/>
→ If bounce isn't working in 20 minutes, exit<br/>
→ Don't hold overnight unless you have strong conviction and catalyst<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Dead Cat Bounce vs. Real Reversal:</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Dead Cat:</Highlight>** Bounces 15-25%, then rolls over and continues falling<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Real Reversal:</Highlight>** Bounces 40-60%, consolidates, continues higher

**<Highlight variant="red">How to Know:</Highlight>** You don't, early on. That's why you take profits fast and manage risk tightly.

## Risk Management: The Knife-Catch Safety Rules

**<Highlight variant="accent">Rule 1:</Highlight>** Position Size = 25% of Normal (Maximum)

→ Same as parabolic short—this is extreme risk<br/>
→ Catching falling knives destroys accounts<br/>
→ Size small, survive to trade another day

**<Highlight variant="accent">Rule 2:</Highlight>** Hard Stops Below Washout Low

→ If price breaks below the washout low, you're wrong<br/>
→ It's not done falling<br/>
→ Exit immediately, no questions

**<Highlight variant="accent">Rule 3:</Highlight>** Never Buy During the Cascade

→ "Don't catch a falling knife"<br/>
→ Wait for the washout candle<br/>
→ Wait for the first green reversal<br/>
→ Patience saves accounts here

**<Highlight variant="accent">Rule 4:</Highlight>** Take Profits at VWAP (Minimum)

→ Most bounces stall at VWAP<br/>
→ Take at least 50% profit there<br/>
→ Don't get greedy hoping for full retracement

**<Highlight variant="accent">Rule 5:</Highlight>** Avoid Multi-Day Runners That Are Truly Dead

→ If the catalyst is disproven (FDA rejection, fraud news, delisting)<br/>
→ The bounce will be weak or nonexistent<br/>
→ This is a falling knife that stays down<br/>
→ Skip these entirely

## Complementary Relationship: Two Sides of Extreme Momentum

Both setups trade mean reversion from extreme extension. They're mirror images:

**<Highlight variant="accent">Parabolic Short:</Highlight>**

→ Extreme upward extension → Reversion down<br/>
→ You're shorting euphoria<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Timing:</Highlight>** Wait for exhaustion on the way up

**<Highlight variant="accent">Panic Dip Buy:</Highlight>**

→ Extreme downward extension → Reversion up<br/>
→ You're buying capitulation<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Timing:</Highlight>** Wait for washout on the way down

**<Highlight variant="blue">The Common Thread:</Highlight>**

→ Both require waiting for the extreme to exhaust<br/>
→ Both trade the snap-back (mean reversion)<br/>
→ Both are high-risk, high-reward<br/>
→ Both punish early entries and reward patience

<br />

**<Highlight variant="blue">Practice Drill:</Highlight>** Watch 3-5 volatile tickers daily. Identify moments of extreme momentum
(parabolic up or panic down). Mark where exhaustion/washout occurred.
Track if mean reversion followed. Build pattern library over weeks.

**<Highlight variant="accent">2\. Timing: Entering at the Right Moment</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="yellow">For Parabolic Short:</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="green">Best:</Highlight>** Exhaustion wick appears, enter on break of its low<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Good:</Highlight>** Second candle confirms reversal<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Acceptable:</Highlight>** Break of key moving average<br/>
**<Highlight variant="red">NEVER:</Highlight>** During the acceleration phase (frontside)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">For Panic Dip Buy:</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="green">Best:</Highlight>** Climax volume washout, enter on first green candle<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Good:</Highlight>** VWAP test and hold<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Acceptable:</Highlight>** Higher low formation<br/>
**<Highlight variant="red">NEVER:</Highlight>** During the cascade (falling knife)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="accent">3\. Risk Management: Defining and Controlling Loss</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Position Sizing (Both Setups):</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Risk:</Highlight>** 0.5-1% of account (LOWER than normal)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Position size:</Highlight>** 25% of normal<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Stop distance:</Highlight>** Tight (above wick high OR below washout low)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Example:</Highlight>**

→ $50,000 account<br/>
→ 0.75% risk = $375 max loss<br/>
→ Stop distance = $0.50<br/>
→ Position size = $375 / $0.50 = 750 shares (vs. normal 3,000 shares) <br/>

## Final Thoughts: Respect the Extremes

These setups exist at the edge of tradeable momentum — where rational analysis breaks down and emotion takes over.
This is where the Market Magic Box moves at maximum velocity, maximum chaos, maximum danger.

**<Highlight variant="accent">The Parabolic Short trader must have:</Highlight>**

**<CheckCircle className="w-4 h-4 text-green-400 inline-block" />** Ice-cold patience (waiting through the frontside acceleration)<br/>
**<CheckCircle className="w-4 h-4 text-green-400 inline-block" />** Instant execution (entering the moment exhaustion appears)<br/>
**<CheckCircle className="w-4 h-4 text-green-400 inline-block" />** Ruthless discipline (cutting losses when wrong)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="accent">The Panic Dip Buy trader must have:</Highlight>**

**<CheckCircle className="w-4 h-4 text-green-400 inline-block" />** Nerve (buying when everyone else is panicking)<br/>
**<CheckCircle className="w-4 h-4 text-green-400 inline-block" />** Precise timing (waiting for climax volume)<br/>
**<CheckCircle className="w-4 h-4 text-green-400 inline-block" />** Quick profit-taking (not getting greedy on dead cat bounces)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="accent">Both setups will destroy your account if you:</Highlight>**

**<X className="w-4 h-4 text-red-400 inline-block" />** Enter too early (shorting the frontside, catching falling knives)<br/>
**<X className="w-4 h-4 text-red-400 inline-block" />** Size too large (one bad trade wipes you out)<br/>
**<X className="w-4 h-4 text-red-400 inline-block" />** Ignore stops (hoping it comes back)<br/>
**<X className="w-4 h-4 text-red-400 inline-block" />** Get greedy (not taking profits fast)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="accent">Both setups will build your account if you:</Highlight>**

**<CheckCircle className="w-4 h-4 text-green-400 inline-block" />** Wait for confirmation (exhaustion wick, climax volume)<br/>
**<CheckCircle className="w-4 h-4 text-green-400 inline-block" />** Size appropriately (25% normal position)<br/>
**<CheckCircle className="w-4 h-4 text-green-400 inline-block" />** Respect stops (cut losses immediately)<br/>
**<CheckCircle className="w-4 h-4 text-green-400 inline-block" />** Take profits fast (1.5R-2R is a win)<br/>

The best traders of these setups share one trait: They pass on 90% of potential trades because the setup isn't perfect.
When they finally enter, they do so with conviction, tight risk, and an exit plan already in mind.

These are not beginner setups. They're not even intermediate setups.
These are advanced, high-risk plays reserved for traders who have mastered everything else first.

If you're not ready, skip them. Master the ORB, the News Plays, the Afternoon Breakouts first.
Come back to these when you've earned the right through consistent profitability and proven risk management.<br/>
The extremes will always be there. They're not going anywhere. But your account might be — if you trade them before you're ready.
