## The Catalyst Hunter's Battlefield

### The Two Faces of Pre-Market Catalysts

The <Highlight variant="yellow">News Play</Highlight> and its dark twin, the <Highlight variant="yellow">Pop and Drop</Highlight>, represent two sides of the <Highlight variant="blue">same catalyst-driven coin</Highlight>.
They occur on the same tickers, triggered by the same news, during the same time windows.
But they move in opposite directions, driven by different resolutions of the same question:

_<span style={{ color: '#faf0aa' }}>Will this catalyst create sustained momentum, or is it just another pre-market mirage
that evaporates at the open?</span>_

This is where the Market Magic Box becomes your early warning system.
You're not just reading headlines — you're watching particle behavior in the first moments after a catalyst.
Are buyers swarming with conviction? Is volume expanding with purpose?
Or is this a flash of energy that will exhaust itself before breakfast?

This lesson teaches you to recognize both outcomes and position yourself on the winning side.

## The News Play (Long): Riding the Catalyst Wave

### <Highlight variant="accent">Box State Analysis</Highlight>

When genuine news hits a low-float ticker in the pre-market hours, the <Highlight variant="blue">Market Magic Box</Highlight> transforms into a <Highlight variant="blue">pressure chamber</Highlight>.
Here's what's happening at the particle level:

**<Highlight variant="green">Particles (buyers)</Highlight>** flood into a confined space (<Highlight variant="yellow">low float</Highlight>). Supply walls thin out as existing sellers get absorbed.
Velocity increases with each successive candle. The box is compressing energy, building momentum toward the opening bell.

This isn't random buying — it's directional particle flow driven by information asymmetry.
Early traders who recognize the materiality of the catalyst are positioning before the crowd arrives.

**<Highlight variant="blue">Your job:</Highlight>** identify this compression early and ride the expansion.

### <Highlight variant="accent">Setup Overview</Highlight>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Category:</Highlight>** Catalyst/Momentum<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Direction:</Highlight>** Long<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Complementary Setup:</Highlight>** Pop and Drop (Short)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Time of Day:</Highlight>** 7:00 AM - 9:30 AM EST (News releases at 7:00, 7:30, 8:00, 8:30, 9:00 AM)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Ideal Timeframe:</Highlight>** Entry on 1-minute, Exit planning on 5-minute<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Risk Level:</Highlight>** Medium-High (★★★☆☆)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Average Success Rate:</Highlight>** 60-80% (cycle-dependent)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Average Risk/Reward:</Highlight>** 1:1.5 to 1:3 (occasional 1:5+)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Volume Requirement:</Highlight>** High and increasing (though not visible at early entry)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Float Preference:</Highlight>** 1M - 10M shares (max 20M)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Required Catalyst:</Highlight>** Material, relevant news in hot sectors or biotech Phase 2/3 results<br/>

## The Multi-Skill Challenge

Playing news releases successfully requires you to master <Highlight variant="blue">three distinct skillsets</Highlight> simultaneously:

### <Highlight variant="accent">1. News Filtering (The First Battle)</Highlight>

Not all news is created equal. Before you even look at a chart, you need to separate signal from noise.

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Material Catalysts (Trade These):</Highlight>**

**<CheckCircle className="w-4 h-4 text-green-400 inline-block" />** FDA Phase 2/3 clinical trial results (especially positive data)<br/>
**<CheckCircle className="w-4 h-4 text-green-400 inline-block" />** Partnership announcements with major pharmaceutical companies<br/>
**<CheckCircle className="w-4 h-4 text-green-400 inline-block" />** Contract wins with specific revenue numbers<br/>
**<CheckCircle className="w-4 h-4 text-green-400 inline-block" />** Breakthrough therapy designations<br/>
**<CheckCircle className="w-4 h-4 text-green-400 inline-block" />** Hot sector momentum (AI, biotech breakthroughs, energy shifts)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Fluffy Catalysts (Fade These):</Highlight>**

**<X className="w-4 h-4 text-red-400 inline-block" />** Vague "exploring opportunities" press releases<br/>
**<X className="w-4 h-4 text-red-400 inline-block" />** Recycled news from weeks ago<br/>
**<X className="w-4 h-4 text-red-400 inline-block" />** Generic conference attendance announcements<br/>
**<X className="w-4 h-4 text-red-400 inline-block" />** Executive appointments without strategic context<br/>
**<X className="w-4 h-4 text-red-400 inline-block" />** Research coverage initiations with no price target<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">The 10-Second Filter:</Highlight>**

Ask yourself: <span style={{ color: '#faf0aa' }}>"If I saw this headline on CNBC, would institutional buyers care, or would they laugh?"</span>

If you can't explain in one sentence why this news matters, it's probably fluff.

### <Highlight variant="accent">2. Speed and Execution (The Second Battle)</Highlight>

Once you've identified legitimate news, the clock is ticking. You have <Highlight variant="red">seconds — not minutes</Highlight> — to assess and execute.

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Pre-Market Scanner Setup:</Highlight>**

<GridList
  items={[
    {
      title: 'Gapper scanner showing pre-market % gainers',
    },
    {
      title: 'Volume scanner (relative volume > 2.0)',
    },
    {
      title: 'News feed (Benzinga, PR Newswire, GlobeNewswire)',
    },
    {
      title: 'Float filter (<20M shares)',
    },
  ]}
/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Decision Tree (30 seconds max):</Highlight>**

1\. News drops → Read headline<br/>
2\. Material or fluff? (5 seconds)<br/>
3\. Check chart → Is it already extended? (5 seconds)<br/>
4\. Check float + sector (5 seconds)<br/>
5\. Market cycle check: Are longs chasing lately? (5 seconds)<br/>
6\. Execute or pass (10 seconds)<br/>

This is pattern recognition trained through repetition, not overthinking.

### <Highlight variant="accent">3. Directional Bias (The Third Battle)</Highlight>

This is the hardest skill: determining whether this specific catalyst on this specific ticker will hold or fade.

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Factors Favoring a Long Hold:</Highlight>**

**<CheckCircle className="w-4 h-4 text-green-400 inline-block" />** Hot Market Cycle: Longs have been winning lately, chasing is rewarded<br/>
**<CheckCircle className="w-4 h-4 text-green-400 inline-block" />** Sector in Play: Multiple tickers in the same sector showing strength<br/>
**<CheckCircle className="w-4 h-4 text-green-400 inline-block" />** Low Float + Material News: Under 5M float with Phase 3 approval = explosive potential<br/>
**<CheckCircle className="w-4 h-4 text-green-400 inline-block" />** Pre-Market Strength: Price holding gains, not fading back<br/>
**<CheckCircle className="w-4 h-4 text-green-400 inline-block" />** Volume Pattern: Each wave higher brings more volume, not less<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Factors Favoring a Fade (Skip the Long):</Highlight>**

**<X className="w-4 h-4 text-red-400 inline-block" />** Cold Market Cycle: Longs are getting punished, hesitancy everywhere<br/>
**<X className="w-4 h-4 text-red-400 inline-block" />** Ticker History: This company releases "news" every week that goes nowhere<br/>
**<X className="w-4 h-4 text-red-400 inline-block" />** Already Extended: Stock up 100%+ in pre-market before you even see it<br/>
**<X className="w-4 h-4 text-red-400 inline-block" />** Volume Declining: First spike big, but each wave lower volume<br/>
**<X className="w-4 h-4 text-red-400 inline-block" />** Fluffy Catalyst: No substance behind the headline<br/>

## Entry Strategies: Fast vs. Slow

There are two distinct entry approaches for the News Play, each with different risk profiles.

### <Highlight variant="accent">Approach 1: The Aggressive Entry (Fast)</Highlight>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Entry Point:</Highlight>** First or second 1-minute candle after news release<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Advantages:</Highlight>** Best risk/reward, earliest position, maximum profit potential<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Risks:</Highlight>** Immediate roundtrip if news doesn't stick<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Execution:</Highlight>**

→ News drops at 8:00 AM<br/>
→ Price jumps on first 1-min candle with volume<br/>
→ You enter on the close of the first candle OR on a brief pullback in the second candle<br/>
→ Stop loss: below the low of the entry candle (tight risk)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Box State:</Highlight>** You're entering as particles first flood the chamber.
The wall hasn't broken yet — you're positioned for the breakout.<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">When to Use:</Highlight>** When catalyst is clearly material, float is tiny, and you're confident this has legs.<br/>

### <Highlight variant="accent">Approach 2: The Confirmation Entry (Slow)</Highlight>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Entry Point:</Highlight>** After first leg completes and price consolidates at support<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Advantages:</Highlight>** Confirmation that momentum is real, better risk/reward visibility<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Risks:</Highlight>** Smaller profit potential, might miss explosive moves<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Execution:</Highlight>**

→ News drops, stock rips up on first 5-min candle<br/>
→ Price pulls back to VWAP or 9-EMA on the 5-min chart<br/>
→ Volume remains elevated (doesn't die)<br/>
→ You enter the bounce off support with tighter stop<br/>
→ Stop loss: break of VWAP or 9-EMA (clear technical level)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Box State:</Highlight>** First wave of particles established a new demand zone.
You're entering as the second wave arrives.<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">When to Use:</Highlight>** When you're less certain, when you missed the initial move,
or when you want higher probability at the expense of R/R.<br/>

## Position Management & Exits

This is where psychology separates amateurs from professionals.

The <Highlight variant="yellow">Golden Rules:</Highlight>

**<Highlight variant="green">1\. Let Winners Run:</Highlight>** If the stock is moving in your favor, don't take profits in 2-10 minutes.
Let it develop on the 5-minute timeframe. You're looking for 30-60 minute holds on strong catalysts.<br/>

**<Highlight variant="red">2\. Cut Losers Fast:</Highlight>** If you enter and the stock immediately roundtrips (breaks your entry candle low), you're out.
No negotiation. This is the market telling you the catalyst failed.<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">3\. Scale Out on Resistance:</Highlight>** As price approaches whole dollar levels or previous resistance, take partial profits (30-50%).
Let the rest ride with a trailing stop.

**<Highlight variant="yellow">4\. Watch the 5-Min Chart:</Highlight>** Your entry might be on the 1-min, but your exit decisions come from 5-min structure. Are we making higher highs? Is volume still strong? Is this consolidating or rolling over?

**<Highlight variant="blue">Target Zones:</Highlight>**

→ First target: 1.5R (Risk $100, target $150 profit)<br/>
→ Second target: 2-3R<br/>
→ Home run scenario: 5R+ (when stock becomes "the play of the day")<br/>

## The Market Cycle Dependency

This setup's success rate swings dramatically based on the broader market environment.

**<Highlight variant="green">Hot Cycle Characteristics:</Highlight>**

<GridList
  items={[
    {
      title: 'News-driven gappers are holding and extending',
    },
    {
      title: 'Retail traders are aggressive, chasing quickly',

    },
    {
      title: 'FOMO (fear of missing out) drives momentum',
    },
    {
      title: 'Success rate: 70-80%',
    },
  ]}
/>

**<Highlight variant="red">Cold Cycle Characteristics:</Highlight>**

<GridList
  items={[
    {
      title: 'News-driven gappers are fading fast',
    },
    {
      title: 'Retail traders are hesitant, waiting for confirmation',
    },
    {
      title: 'Longs are quick to take profits or cut losses',
    },
    {
      title: 'Skepticism dominates sentiment',
    },
    {
      title: 'Success rate: 40-60%',
    },
  ]}
/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">How to Gauge the Cycle:</Highlight>**

Look at the last 5-10 news plays over the past week. Are they holding into the open and extending?
Or are they popping and immediately fading? The market tells you how to trade it.

**<Highlight variant="blue">Adaptation:</Highlight>** In cold cycles, reduce position size, tighten stops,
and favor the confirmation entry over the aggressive entry.

<hr />

## The Pop and Drop (Short): Fading the Mirage

### <Highlight variant="accent">Box State Analysis</Highlight>

The <Highlight variant="red">Pop and Drop</Highlight> is the News Play's evil twin. Same catalyst, same ticker, same time — but opposite outcome.

Here's what happens in the <Highlight variant="blue">Market Magic Box:</Highlight>

News hits. Particles (buyers) rush in aggressively, creating a velocity spike. But the energy is shallow —
there's no depth behind it. Supply zones above price remain thick. After the first leg up, particle flow decelerates. Volume dries up.
The buyers who rushed in early start to panic. The Market Magic Box <Highlight variant="blue">reverses polarity, and the sellers take control.</Highlight>

This is <Highlight variant="red">energy exhaustion followed by a reversal cascade.</Highlight>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Your job:</Highlight>** recognize when the catalyst is weak and position for the fade.

### <Highlight variant="accent">Setup Overview</Highlight>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Category:</Highlight>** Reversal/Fade<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Direction:</Highlight>** Short<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Complementary Setup:</Highlight>** News Play (Long)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Time of Day:</Highlight>** 7:00 AM - 9:30 AM EST<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Ideal Timeframe:</Highlight>** Entry on 5-minute, Exit on 1-5 minute<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Risk Level:</Highlight>** High (★★★★☆)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Average Success Rate:</Highlight>** 70-80% (80% of news plays fade)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Average Risk/Reward:</Highlight>** 1:1 to 1:2<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Volume Requirement:</Highlight>** High initial volume → Declining (exhaustion signal)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Float Preference:</Highlight>** 1M - 10M shares (max 20M)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Required Catalyst:</Highlight>** YES — Same as long, but prefer weak/fluffy news<br/>

## The Short-Bias Reality

Here's a dirty secret of day trading: 80% of pre-market news plays <Highlight variant="red">fade and fail by mid-morning.</Highlight><br/>
Why? Because most catalysts are engineered by companies desperate for attention. They're PR stunts, not fundamental business changes.
The market gets excited for 20 minutes, then reality sets in.<br/>
This creates a structural edge for short-biased traders. They don't need to filter good news from bad —
they just short everything that pops, knowing most will eventually fail.

The <Highlight variant="red">Danger:</Highlight> This mentality leads to massive short squeezes when a legitimate catalyst appears.
The shorts pile in reflexively, and they get annihilated when the 20% of real plays explode higher.<br/>

Your <Highlight variant="green">Edge:</Highlight> You're not a mindless short-seller.
You're using the Market Magic Box to identify which pops have weak particle flow and which have genuine momentum.<br/>

## Entry Strategies: Fast vs. Slow

### <Highlight variant="accent">Approach 1: The Clearout Short (Slow)</Highlight>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Entry Point:</Highlight>** After first leg high is established, waiting for a clearout above that high<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Advantages:</Highlight>** Traps late longs, creates liquidity for your short<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Risks:</Highlight>** Might not get the clearout, miss the fade<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Execution:</Highlight>**

→ News drops, stock rips to $8.50 on the first 5-min candle<br/>
→ Price pulls back to $8.20, consolidates<br/>
→ Stock makes a second push, briefly clears $8.50 (hits $8.60)<br/>
→ Volume on this second push is lower than the first<br/>
→ You short the clearout, stop above $8.70<br/>
→ Stop loss: new high with volume confirmation<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Box State:</Highlight>** This is a liquidity trap. Late buyers are chasing the breakout above the first high.
You're shorting into their enthusiasm, knowing there's no energy left.<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">When to Use:</Highlight>** When the first leg looked strong but the second push is weak, when ticker has fade history.<br/>

### <Highlight variant="accent">Approach 2: The Immediate Roundtrip Short (Fast)</Highlight>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Entry Point:</Highlight>** Within first 5-minute candle if rejection is immediate
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Advantages:</Highlight>** Fastest entry, catches the full fade
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Risks:</Highlight>** Higher risk of squeeze if news is actually strong

**<Highlight variant="blue">Execution:</Highlight>**

→ News drops at 8:00 AM<br/>
→ Price spikes to $7.80 in first 2 minutes<br/>
→ Immediately rejects, drops to $7.40 within the same 5-min candle<br/>
→ 5-min candle closes as a shooting star / rejection wick<br/>
→ You short on the break of the 5-min low<br/>
→ Stop loss: above the 5-min high<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Box State:</Highlight>** Particles spiked but immediately lost velocity. The box is flipping polarity in real-time.<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">When to Use:</Highlight>** When news is clearly fluffy, when volume dies instantly, when market cycle is cold.<br/>

## X-Ray Vision: Inside the Candle

While the first simulator showed you the macro view, let's look deeper.
Use this X-Ray tool to see how individual particle behavior creates the candle shapes you see on your chart.

<CatalystXRaySimulator />

## The Bleeding Fade Pattern

Not all fades are fast. Some stocks bleed slowly after the initial pop.

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Characteristics:</Highlight>**

→ First push is strong, hits $9.00<br/>
→ Then... nothing. Price just sits there at $8.80-$9.00<br/>
→ Volume dries up completely<br/>
→ No new buyers arriving<br/>
→ Slowly rolls over, loses $0.05-$0.10 every 5 minutes<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">How to Trade:</Highlight>**

→ Wait for the 5-min chart to show a lower high
→ Short the breakdown of the consolidation low
→ Ride the slow bleed with a trailing stop
→ Exit on panic volume (capitulation spike)

**<Highlight variant="blue">Box State:</Highlight>** Particles are trapped, no new energy entering. Slow deceleration leading to eventual cascade.<br/>

<CatalystSimulator3D />

## Risk Management: The Squeeze Killer

Shorting news-driven low floats is inherently dangerous. One out of five times, you'll catch a legitimate catalyst that explodes higher,
and if you don't respect your stop, you'll give back a week of profits in one trade.

**<Highlight variant="red">Non-Negotiable Rules:</Highlight>**

1\. **<Highlight variant="yellow">Always Use a Stop Loss:</Highlight>** No mental stops. Hard stop above the clearout high or the rejection wick.

2\. **<Highlight variant="yellow">Position Size Conservatively:</Highlight>** This is a high-risk setup. Use 25-50% of your normal size.

3\. **<Highlight variant="yellow">Watch for Squeeze Signals:</Highlight>**

→ Volume surging on a move higher<br/>
→ Stock reclaiming VWAP with authority<br/>
→ Breaking above previous high with expanding momentum<br/>
→ If you see these, cover immediately. Don't wait for your stop.<br/>

4\. **<Highlight variant="yellow">Don't Add to Losers:</Highlight>** If your short isn't working, don't average in. Cover and reassess.

5\. **<Highlight variant="yellow">Respect the 20%:</Highlight>** Remember, 20% of these plays are real. If you catch one, accept the loss and move on.

## The Statistical Edge

**<Highlight variant="green">Why This Setup Works:</Highlight>**

**<CheckCircle className="w-4 h-4 text-green-400 inline-block" />** 80% Fade Rate: Most news is fluff, creating a statistical edge<br/>
**<CheckCircle className="w-4 h-4 text-green-400 inline-block" />** Late Long Traps: Retail traders chase headlines without analysis<br/>
**<CheckCircle className="w-4 h-4 text-green-400 inline-block" />** Manipulation Factor: Only 1-2 tickers per day are "the game" (rigged setups). The rest are designed to fade.<br/>
**<CheckCircle className="w-4 h-4 text-green-400 inline-block" />** Short-Side Liquidity: Many traders are conditioned to short pops, creating density in the supply zone<br/>

**<Highlight variant="red">When It Fails:</Highlight>**

**<X className="w-4 h-4 text-red-400 inline-block" />** Legitimate catalyst with institutional interest<br/>
**<X className="w-4 h-4 text-red-400 inline-block" />** Sector momentum driving multiple tickers<br/>
**<X className="w-4 h-4 text-red-400 inline-block" />** Low float (&lt;5M) with material news = squeeze fuel<br/>
**<X className="w-4 h-4 text-red-400 inline-block" />** Hot market cycle rewarding longs<br/>

<hr />

## Complementary Relationship: Reading the Same Battlefield

The genius of pairing these setups is that they train you to read both outcomes of the same situation.

**<Highlight variant="blue">Same Inputs:</Highlight>**

→ Same ticker<br/>
→ Same catalyst<br/>
→ Same float<br/>
→ Same time window<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Different Outputs:</Highlight>**

→ News Play: Catalyst holds, momentum sustains, longs win<br/>
→ Pop and Drop: Catalyst fails, momentum fades, shorts win<br/>

## The Four Skills: Execution Mastery

### <Highlight variant="accent">1\. Recognition: Seeing the Setup Form</Highlight>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">What to Watch:</Highlight>**

→ News scanner for catalyst drops at specific times (7:00, 7:30, 8:00, 8:30, 9:00 AM)<br/>
→ Pre-market volume surge on low-float tickers<br/>
→ Price action: Is it holding or immediately reversing?<br/>
→ Market Magic Box: Are particles flowing with conviction or sputtering?<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Practice Drill:</Highlight>** Every morning, watch the first 10 news releases. Classify each as "Material" or "Fluff" within 10 seconds.
Track which ones hold vs. fade. Build your pattern recognition library.

### <Highlight variant="accent">2\. Timing: Entering at the Right Moment</Highlight>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">For News Play Long:</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="green">Best:</Highlight>** First 1-min candle or second candle pullback (aggressive)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Good:</Highlight>** Pullback to VWAP/EMA after first leg (confirmation)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="red">Avoid:</Highlight>** Chasing after stock is already up 50%+ with declining volume<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">For Pop and Drop Short:</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="green">Best:</Highlight>** First 5-min rejection wick or clearout above first high
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Good:</Highlight>** Breakdown of consolidation after initial spike
**<Highlight variant="red">Avoid:</Highlight>** Shorting into the initial spike with no rejection yet

### <Highlight variant="accent">3\. Risk Management: Defining and Controlling Loss</Highlight>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Position Sizing Formula:</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="blue">Risk per trade:</Highlight>** 1-2% of account (high-risk setup)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="blue">Stop loss:</Highlight>** 1 ATR or technical level (entry candle low/high)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="blue">Position size:</Highlight>** (Account Risk) / (Stop Distance)

**<Highlight variant="blue">Example:</Highlight>**

$50,000 account<br/>
1% risk = $500 max loss<br/>
Stop distance = $0.50<br/>
Position size = $500 / $0.50 = 1,000 shares<br/>

### <Highlight variant="accent">4\. Execution: Pulling the Trigger Without Hesitation</Highlight>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">The Psychological Checklist:</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="blue">Before Entry:</Highlight>**

## Final Thoughts: The Catalyst Hunter's Mindset

Trading news-driven setups requires a unique psychological profile:

**<Highlight variant="green">You must be:</Highlight>**

<GridList
  items={[
    { title: 'Fast: Decisions in seconds, not minutes' },
    { title: 'Disciplined: Stops are non-negotiable' },
    { title: 'Analytical: Separating signal from noise in real-time' },
    { title: 'Flexible: Reading market cycle to adjust bias' },
    { title: "Patient: Letting winners run when they're working" },
  ]}
/>

**<Highlight variant="red">You cannot be:</Highlight>**

<GridList
  items={[
    { title: 'Impulsive: Chasing every headline' },
    { title: 'Stubborn: Holding losers hoping they reverse' },
    { title: 'Greedy: Taking profits too early out of fear' },
    { title: 'Reckless: Oversizing because "this news is huge"' },
  ]}
/>

The traders who master these setups share one trait: they respect the market's verdict.
If the news holds, they ride it. If it fades, they don't fight it.
They let the Market Magic Box show them which direction the particles are flowing, and they flow with them.

  <AlertDescription>
    We'll move from catalyst-driven chaos to structural discipline with the
    Opening Range Breakout (Long) and Gap Up Short (Short) — setups that trade
    the market's opening structure rather than news-driven volatility.
