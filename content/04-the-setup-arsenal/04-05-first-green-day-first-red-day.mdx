## Daily Timeframe Cycle Reversals — Trading the Turning Points

### The Multi-Day Cycle

Everything we've covered so far — Opening Range Breakouts, Parabolic Shorts, Afternoon Breakouts —
these all occur within a single trading day. They're intraday setups with intraday timeframes.

The First Red Day (FRD) and First Green Day (FGD) operate on a different dimension: <Highlight variant="yellow">the daily timeframe</Highlight>.
These setups don't care about 1-minute or 5-minute candles. They're reading multi-day momentum cycles — the ebb and flow of runners
that capture market attention for days or weeks, then inevitably exhaust and reverse.

The <Highlight variant="red">First Red Day</Highlight> is the moment when a multi-day runner finally breaks — when the green candles stop,
profit-taking overwhelms buying pressure, and the first red daily candle appears.
This is where experienced shorts position for a multi-day mean reversion.

The <Highlight variant="green">First Green Day</Highlight> is the moment when the subsequent selloff exhausts — when after 2-4 days of brutal red candles and 40-70% declines,
the first green daily candle finally appears. This is where nimble traders position for a relief bounce.

Critical Distinction: These are NOT:

→ The first day a ticker ever gets a catalyst<br/>
→ The first day a ticker has high volume<br/>
→ The first green or red candle within a trading day<br/>

These are the first RED day after a multi-day GREEN run, and the first GREEN day after the subsequent RED collapse.<br/>
You're trading the cycle turning points of multi-day momentum.

## The First Red Day (FRD): Shorting the Exhaustion

### <Highlight variant="accent">Box State Analysis — Daily Timeframe</Highlight>

To understand the First Red Day, we need to zoom out to the daily chart. Here's what the Market Magic Box looks like across multiple days:

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Day 1-2: Runner Begins</Highlight>**

→ Catalyst triggers initial buying<br/>
→ First two green daily candles form<br/>
→ Volume increasing<br/>
→ Attention building<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Day 3-4: Acceleration Phase</Highlight>**

→ Green candles getting larger<br/>
→ Stock up 100-300% from starting point<br/>
→ Becomes "the play of the week"<br/>
→ Retail chasing, FOMO everywhere<br/>
→ Box State: Particles accelerating upward with increasing velocity<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Day 5 (or 6): The Critical Day</Highlight>**

→ Stock is massively overextended on daily chart<br/>
→ All moving averages far below current price<br/>
→ RSI > 80 (overbought)<br/>
→ Everyone watching, everyone talking about it<br/>
→ This is when the First Red Day typically forms<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Two Scenarios for Day 5:</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="blue">Scenario A: Gap Up, Then Fail</Highlight>**

→ Stock gaps up pre-market (continuation attempt)<br/>
→ Opens at 9:30 AM strong<br/>
→ Within first hour: selling overwhelms buying<br/>
→ Closes red (below previous day close)<br/>
→ First Red Day confirmed<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Scenario B: Gap Down from the Start</Highlight>**

→ Pre-market: stock gaps down (weakness emerging)<br/>
→ Opens below previous close<br/>
→ Never recovers, closes lower<br/>
→ First Red Day confirmed<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Box State on FRD:</Highlight>**

→ Particles that were accelerating upward suddenly decelerate<br/>
→ Profit-takers (early buyers from Day 1-2) overwhelming new buyers<br/>
→ Shorts attacking aggressively<br/>
→ The daily candle closes RED—the streak is broken<br/>
→ Mean reversion on the daily timeframe begins<br/>

## Identifying the Setup: The Daily Chart Tells the Story

Before you even consider shorting the First Red Day, you need to confirm the context on the daily chart.

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Pre-Qualification Checklist:</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="accent">1\. Multi-Day Green Streak (3-5 Days Minimum)</Highlight>**

→ Stock has been green for at least 3 consecutive days<br/>
→ Ideally 4-5 days (more extended = higher probability FRD)<br/>
→ Each day closing higher than the previous <br/>

**<Highlight variant="accent">2\. Significant % Gain (100%+ Ideal)</Highlight>**

→ Stock has moved 100-500% from the starting point<br/>
→ The bigger the move, the more extended, the higher probability of FRD<br/>
→ Example: Day 1 at $3.00 → Day 5 at $12.00 (300% gain) <br/>

**<Highlight variant="accent">3\. Daily Candle Size Increasing</Highlight>**

→ Daily candles getting progressively larger<br/>
→ This signals acceleration (parabolic on daily timeframe)<br/>
→ Similar to intraday parabolic, but across days <br/>

**<Highlight variant="accent">4\. Volume Pattern</Highlight>**

→ Volume increasing or staying elevated<br/>
→ Ideally: highest volume on Day 3-4, starting to taper on Day 5<br/>
→ Declining volume on new highs = divergence (bullish exhaustion) <br/>

**<Highlight variant="accent">5\. Technical Overextension</Highlight>**

→ Price far above all moving averages (20-day, 50-day, 200-day)<br/>
→ RSI > 75-80 on daily chart<br/>
→ Bollinger Bands expanded to extremes<br/>
→ No support underneath (air gap back to lower prices) <br/>

**<Highlight variant="accent">6\. Market Awareness</Highlight>**

→ Stock is "the talk of the market"
→ Retail heavily involved<br/>
→ Social media mentions exploding<br/>
→ When everyone knows about it, the top is near<br/>

If 4+ of these criteria are met, you're watching for the First Red Day.

## The Four Entry Strategies for FRD

**<Highlight variant="accent">Entry 1: The Gap Up Fade (Most Common)</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Setup:</Highlight>**

→ After 4-5 green days, stock gaps up in pre-market<br/>
→ Longs think: "It's going to run again today!"<br/>
→ You think: "This is the top, time to short"<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Execution:</Highlight>**

→ Pre-market: Stock gaps from $10.00 (previous close) to $11.50<br/>
→ 9:30 AM: Opens at $11.50, trades as high as $11.80<br/>
→ Within first 30 minutes: Selling pressure emerges<br/>
→ Price fades from $11.80 to $10.50<br/>
→ Enter short around $10.50-$11.00 (the fade)<br/>
→ Stop loss: Above pre-market high ($11.80) or intraday high<br/>
→ Target: Previous day close ($10.00), then extensions lower<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Why It Works:</Highlight>**

→ Early buyers (Day 1-2) are taking profits<br/>
→ New buyers at the gap are instantly underwater<br/>
→ Shorts attacking the overextension<br/>
→ Gap becomes a "trap" for late longs<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Risk:</Highlight>**

→ If gap holds and continues higher, you're wrong<br/>
→ Tight stop required<br/>

**<Highlight variant="accent">Entry 2: The Break of Previous Close (Technical)</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Setup:</Highlight>**

→ Stock gaps down OR opens flat<br/>
→ Previous day close becomes a resistance level<br/>
→ Breakdown of previous close confirms FRD<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Execution:</Highlight>**

→ Previous close: $10.00<br/>
→ Pre-market: Stock gaps down to $9.50, or opens at $9.90<br/>
→ Stock attempts to reclaim $10.00, fails<br/>
→ Breaks below $9.50 with volume<br/>
→ Enter short on break and hold below previous close<br/>
→ Stop loss: Reclaim above previous close ($10.00)<br/>
→ Target: Previous support levels, 10-20% down <br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Why It Works:</Highlight>**

→ Previous close is psychological level<br/>
→ Failure to reclaim signals weakness<br/>
→ Technical breakdown triggers more selling<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Risk:</Highlight>**

→ False breakdown—price reclaims and squeezes<br/>

**<Highlight variant="accent">Entry 3: The Pre-Market Gap Down Retest (Rejection)</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Setup:</Highlight>**

→ Stock gaps down significantly in pre-market<br/>
→ At the open, it attempts to fill the gap (retest previous close)<br/>
→ Rejection at previous close confirms FRD<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Execution:</Highlight>**

→ Previous close: $10.00<br/>
→ Pre-market gap down to $8.50<br/>
→ 9:30 AM: Opens at $8.50, immediately rallies to $9.80 (gap fill attempt)<br/>
→ Rejects at $9.80-$10.00 (previous close now resistance)<br/>
→ Enter short on rejection with volume<br/>
→ Stop loss: Break and hold above $10.00<br/>
→ Target: Pre-market lows ($8.50), then extensions<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Why It Works:</Highlight>**

→ Previous close acts as "magnet" (failed breakout area)<br/>
→ Rejection confirms sellers in control<br/>
→ Shorts use this level to attack<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Risk:</Highlight>**

→ If it breaks through previous close, gap fill squeezes shorts<br/>

**<Highlight variant="accent">Entry 4: The Pre-Market Positioning ("Foot in the Water")</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Setup:</Highlight>**

→ Extreme overextension visible on daily chart (Day 5+)<br/>
→ You're highly confident FRD is forming<br/>
→ You want early positioning before the crowd realizes<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Execution:</Highlight>**

→ Pre-market: Stock at $11.00, you short small position (25% normal size)<br/>
→ This is your "foot in the water" position<br/>
→ 9:30 AM: Open confirms your thesis (selling pressure)<br/>
→ Add to position at the open (bring to 50-75% normal size)<br/>
→ OR: If wrong (continues higher), cut the small loss immediately<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Why It's Done:</Highlight>**

→ Gets you positioned before the intraday crowd<br/>
→ Allows you to average down if thesis confirms<br/>
→ Limits risk (small size initially)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Risk:</Highlight>**

→ Pre-market has no circuit breakers (can squeeze infinitely)<br/>
→ ONLY do this if highly confident and using tiny size<br/>
→ Never hold large size through open if wrong<br/>

## Position Management: Multi-Day Thinking

Unlike intraday setups, the First Red Day short can be held for multiple days (2-5 days typically).

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Day 1 (FRD Itself):</Highlight>**

→ Entry during first hour<br/>
→ Watch: Does it close red? (Confirms FRD)<br/>
→ If closes green, you might be early—consider cutting or reducing<br/>
→ If closes red (10-30% down from highs), thesis confirmed<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Day 2 (Second Red Day):</Highlight>**

→ Often continues lower (20-40% down from highs)<br/>
→ Take 30-50% profit<br/>
→ Trail stop on remaining position<br/>
→ Watch for potential bounce (shorts covering)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Day 3-4 (Continued Cascade):</Highlight>**

→ If continues lower (50-70% down from highs), trail stops<br/>
→ Watch for climax volume (capitulation)<br/>
→ This is where First Green Day setup will form<br/>
→ Consider closing shorts before FGD bounce<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Exit Signals:</Highlight>**

→ Closes green on high volume (FGD forming, time to cover)<br/>
→ Reclaims key moving average on daily chart<br/>
→ News catalyst renews the run<br/>
→ You hit your profit target (2R-4R)<br/>

## Risk Management: Daily Timeframe Patience

**<Highlight variant="accent">Rule 1: Position Size Based on Daily Stop</Highlight>**

→ Your stop is on the daily chart (above pre-market high or previous close)<br/>
→ This can be $1-3 per share, much wider than intraday<br/>
→ Size accordingly: smaller share count, wider stop<br/>

**<Highlight variant="accent">Rule 2: Be Patient with Daily Timeframe</Highlight>**

→ This isn't a 30-minute scalp<br/>
→ FRD can take 3-5 days to play out fully<br/>
→ Don't panic on intraday bounces—watch daily close<br/>

**<Highlight variant="accent">Rule 3: Take Profits Systematically</Highlight>**

→ Day 1 (FRD): Hold if closes red<br/>
→ Day 2: Take 30-50% profit<br/>
→ Day 3+: Trail stops, watch for FGD<br/>

**<Highlight variant="accent">Rule 4: Respect Reclaims</Highlight>**

→ If stock reclaims previous close and holds<br/>
→ If closes green on massive volume<br/>
→ Cover immediately—you were early or wrong<br/>

**<Highlight variant="accent">Rule 5: Watch for News</Highlight>**

→ New catalyst can restart the run<br/>
→ Partnership, approval, major contract<br/>
→ Cover on material news, don't fight it<br/>

## The First Green Day (FGD): The Relief Bounce

### <Highlight variant="accent">Box State Analysis — Daily Timeframe</Highlight>

After the First Red Day triggers, the multi-day selloff typically continues for 2-4 more days. Here's what the Market Magic Box looks like:

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Day 5 (FRD): First Red Day</Highlight>**

→ Closes red, down 20-30% from highs<br/>
→ Shorts celebrating<br/>
→ Longs trapped<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Day 6-7: Continued Cascade</Highlight>**

→ Red candles continue<br/>
→ Stock down 40-60% from highs<br/>
→ Panic selling accelerates<br/>
→ "The party is over" sentiment<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Day 8: Maximum Pessimism</Highlight>**

→ Stock down 60-70% from highs<br/>
→ Volume spikes (capitulation)<br/>
→ Everyone bearish<br/>
→ This is when the First Green Day typically forms<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Day 9: The First Green Day</Highlight>**

→ Opens at 9:30 AM<br/>
→ First 5-minute candle: GREEN<br/>
→ Shorts covering (taking profits)<br/>
→ Relief buyers stepping in<br/>
→ Closes green (above previous close)<br/>
→ First Green Day confirmed<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Box State on FGD:</Highlight>**

→ Particles that were cascading downward suddenly decelerate<br/>
→ Short covering creates buying pressure<br/>
→ Oversold bounce begins (mean reversion from extreme extension)<br/>
→ The daily candle closes GREEN—the relief begins<br/>

### <Highlight variant="accent">Setup Overview</Highlight>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Category:</Highlight>** Relief Bounce/Reversal
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Direction:</Highlight>** Long<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Complementary Setup:</Highlight>** First Red Day (Short)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Time of Day:</Highlight>** 9:30 - 9:35 AM EST (first 5-min candle)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Ideal Timeframe:</Highlight>** Daily context, intraday entry on 5-minute<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Risk Level:</Highlight>** Medium-High (★★★☆☆)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Average Success Rate:</Highlight>** 55-70%<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Average Risk/Reward:</Highlight>** 1:3 to 1:5 (tight stop, big target)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Volume Requirement:</Highlight>** Volume surge on FGD<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Float Preference:</Highlight>** Any (lower float = more volatile bounce)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Required Catalyst:</Highlight>** Context-dependent (oversold after FRD cascade)<br/>

## Identifying the Setup: The Daily Chart Context

Before entering the First Green Day long, confirm the context:

**<Highlight variant="blue">Pre-Qualification Checklist:</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="yellow">1\. First Red Day Already Occurred</Highlight>**

→ Clear FRD visible on daily chart (3-5 days prior)<br/>
→ You're not trying to catch a falling knife on Day 1<br/>
→ You're waiting for the cascade to exhaust <br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">2\. Multiple Red Days (2-4 Days Minimum)</Highlight>**

→ After FRD, stock has continued lower for 2-4 days<br/>
→ More red days = more oversold = better bounce potential<br/>
→ Shorts are extended (big gains, ready to cover) <br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">3\. Significant Decline (40-70% from Highs)</Highlight>**

→ Stock has given back 40-70% of the multi-day run<br/>
→ Example: Peaked at $15.00 → Now at $5.00 (66% decline)<br/>
→ The bigger the decline, the more explosive the relief bounce <br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">4\. Volume Spike on Day Before FGD</Highlight>**

→ Day 8 (last red day) shows climax volume<br/>
→ This is capitulation—weak hands washed out<br/>
→ Similar to Panic Dip Buy washout candle (Lesson 4) <br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">5\. Daily RSI Oversold</Highlight>**

→ RSI < 30 on daily chart (oversold)<br/>
→ Bollinger Bands stretched to downside<br/>
→ Conditions ripe for mean reversion bounce <br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">6\. Market Sentiment: Maximum Pessimism</Highlight>**

→ "This ticker is dead"<br/>
→ "Never touching this again"<br/>
→ Social media turns bearish<br/>
→ When everyone is bearish, bounces happen<br/>

If 4+ of these criteria are met, you're watching for the First Green Day<br/>

## The Entry Strategy: First 5-Min Green Candle

The FGD entry is remarkably simple and mechanical:

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Step 1: Watch the Open (9:30 AM)</Highlight>**

→ Stock opens<br/>
→ First 5-minute candle begins forming<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Step 2: Wait for 9:35 AM</Highlight>**

→ First 5-minute candle closes<br/>
→ Is it green? (Close > Open)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Step 3: Enter on Green Close</Highlight>**

→ If first 5-min candle closes green, enter long immediately<br/>
→ OR: Enter on break of first 5-min candle high (confirmation)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Step 4: Set Tight Stop</Highlight>**

→ Stop loss: Below low of first 5-min candle<br/>
→ This is often $0.20-0.50 risk<br/>
→ Tight stop = excellent risk/reward<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Step 5: Target 1:3 to 1:5</Highlight>**

→ Risk: $0.30 per share<br/>
→ Target: $0.90 - $1.50 per share<br/>
→ This is a 20-40% relief bounce typically<br/>

<SniperTrainer />

## Why the First 5-Min Candle Works

**<Highlight variant="accent">The Psychology:</Highlight>**

→ Shorts: "We've been winning for 4 days, time to take profits"<br/>
→ Covering = buying pressure<br/>
→ Dip buyers: "It's oversold, time for a bounce"<br/>
→ New buying pressure<br/>
→ First green candle signals momentum shift<br/>

**<Highlight variant="accent">The Technical:</Highlight>**

→ After multiple red days, first green candle is a reversal signal<br/>
→ Tight stop (first 5-min low) gives excellent R/R<br/>
→ If it's a real bounce, it won't break that low<br/>
→ If it does break, you're out with small loss<br/>

**<Highlight variant="accent">The Risk/Reward:</Highlight>**

→ You're risking $0.30 to make $1.00+ (1:3)<br/>
→ If you're right, bounce can be 20-40% in 1-3 days<br/>
→ If you're wrong, tight stop keeps loss small<br/>

## Position Management: Relief Bounce Targets

The FGD is typically a short-term trade (1-3 days), not a swing trade for weeks.

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Day 1 (FGD Itself):</Highlight>**

→ Entry on first 5-min green candle<br/>
→ Watch: Does it close green on the daily?<br/>
→ If closes green (10-20% up), thesis confirmed<br/>
→ Trail stop using intraday structure<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Day 2 (Second Green Day or Rejection):</Highlight>**

→ If continues higher (20-30% from entry), take 50-70% profit<br/>
→ If rejects and closes red, consider full exit<br/>
→ This is often a dead cat bounce, not a full reversal<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Day 3 (Extended Bounce or Rollover):</Highlight>**

→ If still grinding higher, trail stops tightly<br/>
→ Watch for rejection at key moving averages (20-day EMA)<br/>
→ Target: 30-40% bounce from FGD low<br/>
→ Take profits, don't get greedy<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Exit Signals:</Highlight>**

→ Hits 1:3 to 1:5 risk/reward (take it)<br/>
→ Closes red on high volume (bounce exhausting)<br/>
→ Rejects at moving average or previous resistance<br/>
→ You're up 30-40% from entry (take profits)<br/>

## Risk Management: Don't Overstay

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Rule 1: This Is a Bounce, Not a Reversal</Highlight>**

→ FGD is typically a relief bounce, not a full trend reversal<br/>
→ Stock is not going back to the highs<br/>
→ Take profits at 20-40% bounce<br/>
→ Don't hold for "return to highs" (unlikely)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Rule 2: Tight Stop Is Non-Negotiable</Highlight>**

→ Below first 5-min candle low<br/>
→ If broken, you're out immediately<br/>
→ No "let me see if it comes back"

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Rule 3: Take Profits at 1:3 Minimum</Highlight>**

→ If you risk $0.30, take profits at $0.90+ gain<br/>
→ Don't get greedy hoping for 1:10<br/>
→ Consistent 1:3 wins = profitable over time<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Rule 4: Watch for "Dead Cat Bounce"</Highlight>**

→ Bounces 15-25%, then rolls over and continues down<br/>
→ This is common<br/>
→ Take profits fast, don't overstay<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Rule 5: Don't Fight Continued Weakness</Highlight>**

→ If first 5-min candle closes red (not green), skip the trade<br/>
→ If breaks first 5-min low, exit immediately<br/>
→ Respect the stop<br/>

## Complementary Relationship: The Daily Cycle

The FRD and FGD are two sides of the same multi-day cycle. Understanding both allows you to trade the complete cycle.

**<Highlight variant="blue">The Complete Cycle:</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="accent">Phase 1: The Runner (Days 1-4)</Highlight>**

→ Multi-day green streak<br/>
→ Stock up 100-400%<br/>
→ Attention building<br/>
→ Opportunity: Ride the runner (different setup)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="accent">Phase 2: First Red Day (Day 5)</Highlight>**

→ First red daily candle after green streak<br/>
→ Profit-taking + shorts attacking<br/>
→ Down 20-30% from highs<br/>
→ Opportunity: SHORT the FRD<br/>

**<Highlight variant="accent">Phase 3: The Cascade (Days 6-8)</Highlight>**

→ Continued red candles<br/>
→ Down 40-70% from highs<br/>
→ Panic selling, capitulation<br/>
→ Opportunity: Hold shorts, or wait for FGD<br/>

**<Highlight variant="accent">Phase 4: First Green Day (Day 9)</Highlight>**

→ First green daily candle after cascade<br/>
→ Relief bounce begins<br/>
→ Up 20-40% from lows<br/>
→ Opportunity: LONG the FGD<br/>

**<Highlight variant="accent">Phase 5: The Aftermath (Days 10+)</Highlight>**

→ Either consolidates or continues lower<br/>
→ Often becomes range-bound or dead<br/>
→ Opportunity: Move on to next setup<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Practice Drill:</Highlight>** Each week, identify 3-5 multi-day runners.
Track them daily. Mark when FRD occurs. Then track the cascade and mark when FGD occurs. Build pattern recognition for the complete cycle.

**<Highlight variant="accent">2\. Timing: Entering at the Right Moment</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="yellow">For First Red Day:</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="green">Best:</Highlight>** Gap up fade OR break of previous close<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Good:</Highlight>** Pre-market gap down retest and rejection<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Acceptable:</Highlight>** Small pre-market position + add at open<br/>
**<Highlight variant="red">Avoid:</Highlight>** Shorting during Day 2-3 of the run (too early)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">For First Green Day:</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="green">Best:</Highlight>** First 5-min green candle close<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Good:</Highlight>** Break of first 5-min candle high (confirmation)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Acceptable:</Highlight>** Second green candle (late but safer)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="red">Avoid:</Highlight>** Buying during the cascade (falling knife)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="accent">3\. Risk Management: Defining and Controlling Loss</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Position Sizing (FRD):</Highlight>**

→ Risk: 1-2% of account<br/>
→ Stop: Above pre-market high or previous close (daily level)<br/>
→ This can be $1-3 per share<br/>
→ Size smaller to account for wider stop<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Position Sizing (FGD):</Highlight>**

→ Risk: 1% of account<br/>
→ Stop: Below first 5-min candle low (tight)<br/>
→ This is often $0.20-0.50 per share<br/>
→ Size normally, tight stop allows it<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Example (FGD):</Highlight>**

→ $50,000 account<br/>
→ 1% risk = $500<br/>
→ Stop distance = $0.30<br/>
→ Position size = $500 / $0.30 = 1,666 shares<br/>

## Final Thoughts: Trading the Daily Cycle

The First Red Day and First Green Day are daily timeframe patterns that require a different mindset than intraday setups.

**<Highlight variant="accent">The FRD short trader must have:</Highlight>**

**<CheckCircle className="w-4 h-4 inline" stroke="#22c55e" />** Daily chart awareness (zooming out from intraday noise)<br/>
**<CheckCircle className="w-4 h-4 inline" stroke="#22c55e" />** Patience to wait for 3-5 green days (not shorting Day 2)<br/>
**<CheckCircle className="w-4 h-4 inline" stroke="#22c55e" />** Courage to short strength (gap up fades are scary)<br/>
**<CheckCircle className="w-4 h-4 inline" stroke="#22c55e" />** Multi-day holding discipline (not exiting on first bounce)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="accent">The FGD long trader must have:</Highlight>**

**<CheckCircle className="w-4 h-4 inline" stroke="#22c55e" />** Discipline to wait for the cascade to exhaust (2-4 red days)<br/>
**<CheckCircle className="w-4 h-4 inline" stroke="#22c55e" />** Mechanical entry (first 5-min green candle, no emotions)<br/>
**<CheckCircle className="w-4 h-4 inline" stroke="#22c55e" />** Tight risk management (respecting the tight stop)<br/>
**<CheckCircle className="w-4 h-4 inline" stroke="#22c55e" />** Profit-taking discipline (taking 1:3, not hoping for 1:10)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="accent">Both setups trade mean reversion on the daily timeframe:</Highlight>**

**<CheckCircle className="w-4 h-4 inline" stroke="#22c55e" />** FRD: Reversion from overextended highs<br/>
**<CheckCircle className="w-4 h-4 inline" stroke="#22c55e" />** FGD: Reversion from oversold lows<br/>

Both require understanding that you're trading cycles, not single events. The runner will exhaust (FRD).
The cascade will bounce (FGD). The cycle will complete. Your job is to position at the turning points.

The traders who master these setups share one trait: They can watch a multi-day runner without FOMO.
They don't short on Day 2 or Day 3. They wait for Day 5. They don't buy during the cascade.
They wait for the first green candle. They trade the cycle, not their emotions.

These patterns repeat endlessly in small-cap, volatile stocks. Learn to recognize them on the daily chart,
and you'll have a reliable edge in multi-day momentum reversals.
