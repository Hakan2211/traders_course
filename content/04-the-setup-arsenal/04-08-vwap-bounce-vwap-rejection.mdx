## High-Probability Technical Scalps — Fast Resolution Trades

### The Scalper's Technical Edge

We've covered setups that unfold over hours (Afternoon Breakout), days (First Red Day), or weeks (Reverse Splits).
Now we shift to the opposite extreme: fast-resolution technical scalps that either work immediately or fail within minutes.

The VWAP Bounce and VWAP Rejection are pure technical setups built around the single most important intraday level: <Highlight variant="yellow">Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)</Highlight>.

These aren't swing trades. They're not "wait and see" setups. They are high-probability, tight-risk scalps designed for one purpose:
capture quick moves off VWAP and exit fast.

**<Highlight variant="blue">The Philosophy:</Highlight>**

→ Either it works or it doesn't<br/>
→ If it works: scalp 1:1.5 to 1:3 and exit<br/>
→ If it doesn't: tight stop, small loss, move on<br/>
→ Hold time: 2-15 minutes (not hours, not days)<br/>
→ Success rate: 70-85% (when conditions are met)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Why These Work:</Highlight>**

→ VWAP is the most respected intraday level by institutions and algorithms<br/>
→ It acts as a magnet — price is constantly pulled toward it<br/>
→ When price reaches VWAP after being far away, reactions are predictable and fast<br/>
→ High-probability because you're trading institutional behavior, not retail sentiment<br/>

## Understanding VWAP: The Intraday Anchor

Before trading these setups, you must understand what VWAP is and why it matters.

**<Highlight variant="yellow">What is VWAP?</Highlight>**

Volume Weighted Average Price is a trading benchmark that calculates the average price of a security throughout the day, weighted by volume.

**<Highlight variant="blue">Formula:</Highlight>**

<Math>
  {`VWAP = \\frac{\\sum (\\text{Price} \\times \\text{Volume})}{\\sum \\text{Volume}}`}
</Math>

**<Highlight variant="blue">In Simple Terms:</Highlight>**

→ It's the average price that shares traded at, factoring in volume<br/>
→ Higher-volume trades have more weight in the calculation<br/>
→ Resets every day at market open (9:30 AM EST)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Why VWAP Matters:</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="yellow">1\. Institutional Benchmark:</Highlight>**

→ Institutions use VWAP to measure execution quality<br/>
→ "Did I buy below VWAP or above it?"<br/>
→ Below VWAP = good execution (bought cheaper than average)<br/>
→ Above VWAP = poor execution (bought more expensive than average)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">2\. Algorithmic Anchor:</Highlight>**

→ Algorithms are programmed to respect VWAP<br/>
→ VWAP-based algos enter and exit around this level<br/>
→ Creates predictable behavior at VWAP interactions

**<Highlight variant="yellow">3\. Fair Value Indicator:</Highlight>**

→ Trading above VWAP = buyers in control (demand dominant)<br/>
→ Trading below VWAP = sellers in control (supply dominant)<br/>
→ VWAP = equilibrium (fair value)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">4\. Support and Resistance:</Highlight>**

→ When above VWAP: VWAP acts as support<br/>
→ When below VWAP: VWAP acts as resistance<br/>
→ This is the foundation of both setups<br/>

## The VWAP Bounce (Long): Scalping the Support Test

**<Highlight variant="blue">Box State Analysis</Highlight>**

The VWAP Bounce trades the first pullback to VWAP support after a strong move higher.

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Phase 1: Pre-Market Setup</Highlight>**

→ Fresh catalyst in pre-market (news, earnings, FDA approval)<br/>
→ High pre-market volume (stock is "in play")<br/>
→ Price establishes itself above VWAP during PM<br/>
→ <Highlight variant="blue">Box State:</Highlight> Particles flowing upward with momentum<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Phase 2: Opening Range Breakout</Highlight>**

→ Market opens at 9:30 AM<br/>
→ Stock continues higher, breaks above PM highs<br/>
→ Opening Range Breakout completes (see Lesson 2)<br/>
→ Price reaches morning high (e.g., $10.00)<br/>
→ <Highlight variant="blue">Box State:</Highlight> Expansion phase, particles at maximum distance from VWAP<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Phase 3: The Pullback (Setup Forming)</Highlight>**

→ After reaching highs, profit-taking begins<br/>
→ Price pulls back from $10.00 toward VWAP (e.g., $8.00)<br/>
→ This pullback creates "the moat"<br/>
→ Moat = distance between high ($10.00) and VWAP ($8.00) = $2.00<br/>
→ Volume declining during pullback (orderly, not panic)<br/>
→ <Highlight variant="blue">Box State:</Highlight> Contraction back toward equilibrium (VWAP)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Phase 4: The VWAP Test (Entry)</Highlight>**

→ Price reaches VWAP for the first time after the ORB<br/>
→ This is your scalp entry<br/>
→ Either: Bounces immediately (direct entry)<br/>
→ Or: Wicks below briefly, reclaims fast (reclaim entry)<br/>
→ <Highlight variant="blue">Box State:</Highlight> Particles hitting support level, velocity reverses upward<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Phase 5: The Bounce (Target)</Highlight>**

→ Price bounces from VWAP back toward highs<br/>
→ Target: 50% retracement of the pullback OR resistance levels<br/>
→ Hold time: 5-15 minutes<br/>
→ Exit: 1:1.5 to 1:3 R/R achieved<br/>
→ <Highlight variant="blue">Box State:</Highlight> Particles bouncing from support, retracing toward recent highs<br/>

### <Highlight variant="accent">Setup Overview</Highlight>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Category:</Highlight>** Technical Scalp/Support<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Direction:</Highlight>** Long<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Complementary Setup:</Highlight>** VWAP Rejection (Short)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Time of Day:</Highlight>** 9:45 - 11:00 AM EST (after ORB completes)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Ideal Timeframe:</Highlight>** Entry on 1-5 minute, Exit on 5-15 minute<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Risk Level:</Highlight>** LOW (★★☆☆☆)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Average Success Rate:</Highlight>** 70-85% (when all conditions met)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Average Risk/Reward:</Highlight>** 1:1.5 to 1:3<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Volume Requirement:</Highlight>** High pre-market volume, declining during pullback<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Float Preference:</Highlight>** Any (works on all sizes)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Required Catalyst:</Highlight>** Fresh pre-market catalyst creating initial momentum<br/>

## The Critical Concept: The Moat

"The Moat" is the distance between VWAP and the extreme (high or low).

**<Highlight variant="yellow">For the VWAP Bounce:</Highlight>**

→ Moat = Distance between VWAP and HIGH of day<br/>
→ The larger the moat, the better the setup<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Example 1: Large Moat (GOOD)</Highlight>**

→ High of day: $10.00<br/>
→ VWAP: $8.00<br/>
→ Moat: $2.00 (20% from VWAP to high)<br/>
→ This is a HIGH-PROBABILITY setup<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Example 2: Small Moat (WEAK)</Highlight>**

→ High of day: $10.00<br/>
→ VWAP: $9.70<br/>
→ Moat: $0.30 (3% from VWAP to high)<br/>
→ This is a LOW-PROBABILITY setup<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Why the Moat Matters:</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Large Moat:</Highlight>**

→ Big pullback = more "room" for bounce<br/>
→ Better risk/reward (target 50% retracement = $1.00 move on $0.20 risk)<br/>
→ More psychological distance = stronger bounce potential<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Small Moat:</Highlight>**

→ Price already near highs<br/>
→ Little room to bounce<br/>
→ Poor risk/reward<br/>
→ Higher probability of breaking through highs (not bouncing)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Rule:</Highlight>** Only trade VWAP bounces when the moat is at least 5-10% of stock price.

<br />
If all 6 are checked, you have a high-probability VWAP Bounce setup.

## The Three Entry Methods

**<Highlight variant="accent">Method 1: First Touch Entry (Aggressive)</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="yellow">What It Looks Like:</Highlight>**

→ Price pulls back from $10.00 and touches VWAP at $8.00<br/>
→ You enter immediately on the touch<br/>
→ No wait for confirmation<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Entry:</Highlight>**

→ Long at $8.00 (VWAP level)<br/>
→ Stop: "Soft stop" — break and HOLD below VWAP (not just a wick)<br/>
→ Target: $8.40 (1:2 R/R) or $9.00 (1:5 R/R)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">The "Soft Stop" Concept:</Highlight>**

→ Don't exit on a brief wick below VWAP<br/>
→ Only exit if price breaks below AND HOLDS (closes below on 1-min candle)<br/>
→ Reason: Price often wicks below briefly, then reclaims (this is the liquidity grab)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">When to Use:</Highlight>**

→ Extremely clean setup (all 6 criteria perfect)<br/>
→ High conviction in the bounce<br/>
→ You're experienced with VWAP dynamics<br/>

**<Highlight variant="green">Advantages:</Highlight>**

→ Best entry price<br/>
→ Maximum R/R potential<br/>

**<Highlight variant="red">Risks:</Highlight>**

→ Might wick below before bouncing (psychological test)<br/>
→ Requires discipline to hold through brief dip<br/>

<SoftStopSimulator />
<br />

**<Highlight variant="accent">Method 2: Quick Reclaim Entry (Confirmation)</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="yellow">What It Looks Like:</Highlight>**

→ Price pulls back to VWAP at $8.00<br/>
→ Wicks below to $7.90 (brief flush)<br/>
→ Immediately reclaims back above $8.00 with volume<br/>
→ Green candle closes at $8.10<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Entry:</Highlight>**

→ Long on reclaim above VWAP ($8.05-$8.10)<br/>
→ Stop: Below recent low ($7.85)<br/>
→ Target: Same as Method 1<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Why It Works:</Highlight>**

→ Fast reclaim = buyers defending aggressively<br/>
→ Shorts who entered below VWAP are trapped<br/>
→ Liquidity grab completed, bounce begins<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">When to Use:</Highlight>**

→ You want confirmation before entering<br/>
→ Moderate conviction<br/>
→ Prefer higher probability over best price<br/>

**<Highlight variant="green">Advantages:</Highlight>**

→ Confirmation that VWAP is holding<br/>
→ Trapped shorts add fuel to bounce<br/>

**<Highlight variant="red">Risks:</Highlight>**

→ Slightly worse entry ($8.10 vs. $8.00)<br/>
→ Smaller R/R<br/>

**<Highlight variant="accent">Method 3: Double Bottom Entry (Conservative)</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="yellow">What It Looks Like:</Highlight>**

→ First test of VWAP at $8.00, bounces to $8.30<br/>
→ Pulls back again, tests VWAP second time at $8.00<br/>
→ Holds again, bounces<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Entry:</Highlight>**

→ Long on second test confirmation<br/>
→ Stop: Below second test low ($7.95)<br/>
→ Target: Higher confidence, can target more aggressive levels<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Why It Works:</Highlight>**

→ Double bottom confirms support<br/>
→ Highest probability (support tested twice)<br/>
→ Buyers clearly defending level<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">When to Use:</Highlight>**

→ Conservative approach<br/>
→ Building confidence with the setup<br/>
→ Want maximum probability<br/>

**<Highlight variant="green">Advantages:</Highlight>**

→ Highest success rate<br/>
→ Support clearly confirmed<br/>

**<Highlight variant="red">Risks:</Highlight>**

→ Latest entry (might miss early momentum)<br/>
→ Worst entry price<br/>

## Position Management: The Scalp Mindset

This is a SCALP, not a swing trade. Management is aggressive and fast.

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Entry to 2 Minutes:</Highlight>**

→ Is it bouncing immediately?<br/>
→ YES: Hold, watch for momentum<br/>
→ NO: Tighten stop, prepare to exit<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">2-5 Minutes:</Highlight>**

→ First target approaching (1:1.5 R/R)<br/>
→ Take 50% profit<br/>
→ Move stop to break-even on rest<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">5-10 Minutes:</Highlight>**

→ Second target approaching (1:2 to 1:3 R/R)<br/>
→ Take remaining 50%<br/>
→ OR: If very strong, trail stop and let it run<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">10-15 Minutes:</Highlight>**

→ If still holding, you're pushing it<br/>
→ This is a scalp—take profits<br/>
→ Don't turn a scalp into a hope trade<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Exit Signals:</Highlight>**

→ Hits 1:1.5 to 1:3 target (EXIT)<br/>
→ Breaks and holds below VWAP (stopped out)<br/>
→ Momentum stalls (volume dying, price chopping)<br/>
→ 15 minutes passed (time-based exit)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">The Scalp Mentality:</Highlight>**

→ Get in, get profit, get out<br/>
→ Don't overstay<br/>
→ Don't hope for home runs<br/>
→ Consistent 1:2 R/R scalps = profitable<br/>

## Risk Management: Tight and Disciplined

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Rule 1: Position Size = 100-150% of Normal</Highlight>**

→ This is a high-probability setup<br/>
→ Lower risk (tight stop)<br/>
→ Can size slightly larger<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Rule 2: Soft Stop Management</Highlight>**

→ Don't panic on brief wick below VWAP<br/>
→ Only exit if price HOLDS below (closes below on 1-min)<br/>
→ This takes discipline<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Rule 3: Time-Based Exit</Highlight>**

→ If not working in 10-15 minutes, exit<br/>
→ Don't turn scalp into swing<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Rule 4: Don't Force It</Highlight>**

→ If all 6 criteria aren't met, skip<br/>
→ Small moat? Skip.<br/>
→ Third test of VWAP? Skip.<br/>
→ No pre-market catalyst? Skip.<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Rule 5: Take Profits Fast</Highlight>**

→ At 1:1.5 to 1:3, take it<br/>
→ Don't get greedy<br/>
→ Next bounce setup will come<br/>

## The VWAP Rejection (Short): Scalping the Resistance Test

**<Highlight variant="blue">Box State Analysis</Highlight>**

The VWAP Rejection trades the grind back to VWAP resistance after a failed move.

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Phase 1: The Failed Move</Highlight>**

→ Stock attempted to run (morning or earlier)<br/>
→ Move failed, broke down<br/>
→ Trading BELOW VWAP<br/>
→ <Highlight variant="blue">Box State:</Highlight> Sellers in control, particles flowing downward<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Phase 2: The Low Established</Highlight>**

→ Price reaches a low (e.g., $6.00)<br/>
→ Some buying steps in (oversold bounce)<br/>
→ <Highlight variant="blue">Box State:</Highlight> Temporary support found<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Phase 3: The Grind Back to VWAP (Setup Forming)</Highlight>**

→ Price slowly grinds higher from $6.00 toward VWAP ($8.00)<br/>
→ This creates "the moat"<br/>
→ Moat = distance between low ($6.00) and VWAP ($8.00) = $2.00<br/>
→ Volume declining as it grinds (weak buying)<br/>
→ <Highlight variant="blue">Box State:</Highlight> Particles struggling upward against resistance<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Phase 4: The VWAP Test (Entry)</Highlight>**

→ Price reaches VWAP resistance<br/>
→ This is your scalp entry<br/>
→ Either: Rejects immediately (direct entry)<br/>
→ Or: Clears above briefly, then fails (clearout entry—PREFERRED)<br/>
→ <Highlight variant="blue">Box State:</Highlight> Particles hitting resistance, velocity reverses downward<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Phase 5: The Rejection (Target)</Highlight>**

→ Price rejects from VWAP, fades back toward lows<br/>
→ Target: 50% retracement of the grind OR previous lows<br/>
→ Hold time: 5-15 minutes<br/>
→ Exit: 1:1.5 to 1:3 R/R achieved<br/>
→ <Highlight variant="blue">Box State:</Highlight> Particles rejected from resistance, cascading back toward lows<br/>

### <Highlight variant="accent">Setup Overview</Highlight>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Category:</Highlight>** Technical Scalp/Resistance<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Direction:</Highlight>** Short<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Complementary Setup:</Highlight>** VWAP Bounce (Long)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Time of Day:</Highlight>** 10:00 AM - 3:00 PM EST (after failed move)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Ideal Timeframe:</Highlight>** Entry on 1-5 minute, Exit on 5-15 minute<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Risk Level:</Highlight>** LOW-MEDIUM (★★★☆☆)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Average Success Rate:</Highlight>** 65-80% (when all conditions met)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Average Risk/Reward:</Highlight>** 1:1.5 to 1:3<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Volume Requirement:</Highlight>** Declining volume on grind up<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Float Preference:</Highlight>** Any (works on all sizes)<br/>
**<Highlight variant="yellow">Required Catalyst:</Highlight>** Variable (failed move creates setup)<br/>

## The Moat Concept (Short Side)

**<Highlight variant="yellow">For the VWAP Rejection:</Highlight>**

→ Moat = Distance between VWAP and LOW of day<br/>
→ The larger the moat, the better the setup<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Example 1: Large Moat (GOOD)</Highlight>**

→ VWAP: $8.00<br/>
→ Low of day: $6.00<br/>
→ Moat: $2.00 (25% from VWAP to low)<br/>
→ This is a HIGH-PROBABILITY setup<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Example 2: Small Moat (WEAK)</Highlight>**

→ VWAP: $8.00<br/>
→ Low of day: $7.80<br/>
→ Moat: $0.20 (2.5% from VWAP to low)<br/>
→ This is a LOW-PROBABILITY setup<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Why the Moat Matters (Short Side):</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="green">Large Moat:</Highlight>**

→ Plenty of room to fall<br/>
→ Better risk/reward (target 50% retracement = $1.00 move on $0.20 risk)<br/>
→ More distance = weaker buyers (they're already underwater)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="red">Small Moat:</Highlight>**

→ Price already near lows<br/>
→ Little room to fall<br/>
→ Poor risk/reward<br/>
→ Higher probability of breaking to new lows (different setup)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Rule:</Highlight>** Only trade VWAP rejections when the moat is at least 5-10% of stock price.

If all 6 are checked, you have a high-probability VWAP Rejection setup.

## The Three Entry Methods

**<Highlight variant="accent">Method 1: Direct Rejection Entry</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="yellow">What It Looks Like:</Highlight>**

→ Price grinds from $6.00 to $8.00 (VWAP)<br/>
→ Touches VWAP, immediately rejects<br/>
→ Red candle with upper wick at VWAP<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Entry:</Highlight>**

→ Short at $8.00 (VWAP level) or on close of rejection candle<br/>
→ Stop: Break and hold above VWAP<br/>
→ Target: $7.60 (1:2 R/R) or $7.00 (1:5 R/R)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">When to Use:</Highlight>**

→ Clear rejection visible<br/>
→ Volume dying as it approached VWAP<br/>
→ High conviction<br/>

**<Highlight variant="green">Advantages:</Highlight>**

→ Best entry price<br/>
→ Maximum R/R<br/>

**<Highlight variant="red">Risks:</Highlight>**

→ Might break above briefly before rejecting<br/>

**<Highlight variant="accent">Method 2: Clearout Short (PREFERRED)</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="yellow">What It Looks Like:</Highlight>**

→ Price grinds to $8.00 (VWAP)<br/>
→ Breaks ABOVE VWAP to $8.15-$8.20 (clearout)<br/>
→ Early shorts under VWAP panic and cover<br/>
→ Longs think: "It's breaking out above VWAP!"<br/>
→ Then FAILS, reclaims back below VWAP<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Entry:</Highlight>**

→ Short on reclaim back BELOW VWAP ($7.95-$8.00)<br/>
→ Stop: New high above clearout ($8.25)<br/>
→ Target: Back toward lows<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Why This Is PREFERRED:</Highlight>**

→ Clears out early shorts (they covered, creating liquidity)<br/>
→ Traps new longs (they bought the breakout, now underwater)<br/>
→ Maximum pain = maximum downward pressure<br/>
→ Failed breakout = very bearish<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">When to Use:</Highlight>**

→ **<Highlight variant="blue">This is the BEST version of the setup</Highlight>**<br/>
→ Wait for it if you can

**<Highlight variant="green">Advantages:</Highlight>**

→ Highest probability<br/>
→ Most fuel for downward move<br/>
→ Clear failed breakout<br/>

**<Highlight variant="red">Risks:</Highlight>**

→ Requires patience (might not clearout)<br/>
→ If it does break out above VWAP and holds, you're wrong<br/>

**<Highlight variant="accent">Method 3: Failed Reclaim Entry</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="yellow">What It Looks Like:</Highlight>**

→ Multiple attempts to break above VWAP<br/>
→ First attempt: touches $8.00, rejects to $7.80<br/>
→ Second attempt: touches $8.00 again, rejects to $7.70<br/>
→ Third attempt: can't even reach $8.00, tops at $7.95<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Entry:</Highlight>**

→ Short after 2nd or 3rd failed attempt<br/>
→ Stop: Clean break above VWAP<br/>
→ Target: Previous lows<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Why It Works:</Highlight>**

→ Buyers exhausted, can't reclaim<br/>
→ Lower highs forming (weakness)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">When to Use:</Highlight>**

**<Highlight variant="blue">Conservative approach</Highlight>**
→ Want confirmation of rejection<br/>

**<Highlight variant="green">Advantages:</Highlight>**

→ High probability (rejection confirmed)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="red">Risks:</Highlight>**

→ Later entry (missed early move)<br/>

## Position Management: The Scalp Mindset (Short)

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Entry to 2 Minutes:</Highlight>**

→ Is it rejecting immediately?<br/>
→ YES: Hold, watch for momentum down<br/>
→ NO: Tighten stop, prepare to cover<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">2-5 Minutes:</Highlight>**

→ First target approaching (1:1.5 R/R)<br/>
→ Cover 50%<br/>
→ Move stop to break-even on rest<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">5-10 Minutes:</Highlight>**

→ Second target approaching (1:2 to 1:3 R/R)<br/>
→ Cover remaining 50%<br/>
→ OR: If very strong rejection, trail stop<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">10-15 Minutes:</Highlight>**

→ If still holding, close it<br/>
→ This is a scalp—take profits<br/>
→ Don't overstay<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Exit Signals:</Highlight>**

→ Hits 1:1.5 to 1:3 target (COVER)<br/>
→ Breaks and holds above VWAP (stopped out)<br/>
→ Momentum stalls (volume dying, price chopping)<br/>
→ 15 minutes passed (time-based exit)<br/>

## Risk Management: Tight and Disciplined

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Rule 1: Position Size = 75-100% of Normal</Highlight>**

→ Slightly riskier than VWAP bounce (resistance can break)<br/>
→ Use conservative size

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Rule 2: Respect VWAP Breaks</Highlight>**

→ If it breaks above VWAP and HOLDS<br/>
→ Cover immediately<br/>
→ Don't fight strength

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Rule 3: Watch for New Catalysts</Highlight>**

→ If news breaks while you're short<br/>
→ Cover immediately<br/>
→ Don't fight fundamentals

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Rule 4: Time-Based Exit</Highlight>**

→ 10-15 minutes max hold<br/>
→ Scalp, not swing

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Rule 5: Take Profits Fast</Highlight>**

→ At 1:1.5 to 1:3, cover<br/>
→ Next rejection will come

## Complementary Relationship: VWAP as the Anchor

Both setups trade the same principle: VWAP is a magnet and a dividing line.

**<Highlight variant="yellow">VWAP Bounce (Long):</Highlight>**

→ Trading ABOVE VWAP = buyers in control<br/>
→ VWAP = support<br/>
→ First pullback = high-probability bounce<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">VWAP Rejection (Short):</Highlight>**

→ Trading BELOW VWAP = sellers in control<br/>
→ VWAP = resistance<br/>
→ Grind to VWAP = high-probability rejection<br/>

**<Highlight variant="yellow">The Cycle:</Highlight>**

→ Stock above VWAP → pulls back → bounces (Long)<br/>
→ Bounce fails → breaks below VWAP → grinds back → rejects (Short)<br/>
→ Rejection fades → finds support → grinds back → bounces (Long)<br/>

Understanding BOTH setups allows you to scalp both directions as price interacts with VWAP throughout the day.

## Final Thoughts: The Scalper's Discipline

The VWAP Bounce and Rejection are not home run trades. They're not multi-day holds. They're not "let it run" setups.<br/>
They are high-probability technical scalps designed for one thing: consistent, repeatable profits with tight risk.

**<Highlight variant="accent">The VWAP bounce trader must have:</Highlight>**

→ Patience to wait for first test<br/>
→ Discipline to use soft stops (not panic on wicks)<br/>
→ Decisiveness to take 1:2 to 1:3 and exit<br/>

**<Highlight variant="accent">The VWAP rejection trader must have:</Highlight>**

→ Patience to wait for clearout (preferred)<br/>
→ Discipline to cover on VWAP reclaim<br/>
→ Decisiveness to scalp and move on<br/>

Both require understanding that VWAP is not a line in the sand — it's a magnetic equilibrium level that price constantly gravitates toward and reacts to.

The traders who master these setups share one trait: They don't get greedy. They take their 1:2, 1:3 R/R scalps, exit, and wait for the next setup.
They understand that consistency beats home runs in scalping.

These are bread-and-butter setups. They happen daily. Master them, and you have a reliable source of income that works regardless of market direction.
