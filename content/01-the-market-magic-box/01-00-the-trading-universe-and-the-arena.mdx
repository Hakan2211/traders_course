  Alright, let me tell you how this course almost never happened...
</span>

I had 25,878 ideas for how to start this course. I wanted to teach you everything
— from "What is money?" to the entire history of currency, complete with supply-demand
curves.

Then the other half of my brain kicked in: "Dude, this is a Trading course, not a
Harvard economics semester. Nobody signed up to be bored to death."

So what did I do? I procrastinated. One day became ten. Ten became a month.<br/>
Classic,right?<br/>
But then I figured it out: Keep it simple. Keep it real. Keep it exciting.
All that "boring but important" stuff? It's in the glossary if you want it. But we're
starting where it matters. <br />
Let's jump right in.

## Why Markets Exist & the Arena of Trading

Let's talk about the playing field. Which markets exist? How massive are they?
What are we actually trading? We'll compare them visually — size, volatility, liquidity — so you can see the whole picture.

After this, we'll dive into the layers of trading, then get into the technicals and introduce you to the <Highlight variant="blue">Magic Market Box</Highlight>.
Trust me, it's going to click.

### The Six Major Financial Markets

Here's the lineup. These are the heavy hitters in the financial world:

Yeah, there are other markets like real estate, but we're keeping it focused on what traders actually trade in the financial markets.

Check out the 3D visualization of the markets below (click and drag to rotate, scroll to zoom):
These boxes show the total size of each <Highlight variant="blue">market in 2023</Highlight>. Spoiler: we're talking _massive_ numbers.
We are using logarithmic scale to make the smaller markets more visible. Logarithmic preserves relative differences while keeping all markets visible.
I implemented a Panel Control to switch between total size, daily volume, and annual volume and to show or hide the labels.
You can also change the scale type from logarithmic to linear and back.

  <AlertTitle>The total? Over $1 QUADRILLION.</AlertTitle>

    By 2023, the total global market value crossed $1 *quadrillion* in notional

Markets aren't just about size. They differ wildly in how they move <Highlight variant="yellow">volatility</Highlight> and how<Highlight variant="yellow">liquid</Highlight> they are (how easily you can buy and sell).

Below is an interactive 3D visualization of market dynamics:

- **Volatility (waves)**: the stronger and faster the surface waves on a box, the higher the market's volatility.
- **Liquidity (particles)**: denser, faster-moving particle clouds = more liquid markets.

### Where We're Trading: US Equities

<Highlight variant="blue">US-Listed Equities</Highlight>. That's <Highlight variant="yellow">
  our playground
</Highlight>. It's big — but smaller than Forex. Volatility depends on market cap
and float. Liquidity depends on the ticker, the news, cycle, the price, and the story
behind it.

It's the sweet spot: big enough to have opportunities everywhere, liquid enough to get in and out,
volatile enough to profit — but not so crazy you lose your mind (looking at you, crypto).

Let's zoom in our battlefield and see how the US stacks up against the rest of the world.

<Alert variant="info">
  <AlertTitle>
    Total Global Equity Market Cap: $127 Trillion (2024-2025)
  </AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    Think about that for a second. Every publicly traded company on Earth — from
    Apple to some tiny zinc mine in Australia — adds up to $127 trillion.
    <br />
    But here's what's wild: the US doesn't just participate. It dominates.
  </AlertDescription>
</Alert>

<InfoGrid showContainer={true} containerClassName="border border-[#182538]">
  <InfoGridItem
    title="US-Equities Market Cap"
    value="$62.2 Trillion. 49.1% of all global equity value"
    description="Nearly half of all global stock value is American. That's the S&P 500, NASDAQ, NYSE—the whole machine. The US market isn't just big, it's the center of gravity."
  />
  <InfoGridItem
    title="Rest of the World-Equities Market Cap"
    value="$64.8 Trillion. 50.9% of all global equity value"
    description="Europe, Asia-Pacific, emerging markets, everyone else combined. It's slightly bigger than the US by total value, but way more fragmented across countries, currencies, and time zones."
  />
</InfoGrid>

The US market has the deepest liquidity, most transparent reporting (if you ignore China scams), longest trading hours overlap , and most innovation.
When you trade US equities, you are playing in the most developed, most liquid, most watched market on the planet.

Now let's slice up the US market.
The $62.3 trillion US equity market isn't one big monolith. It's made up of winners and strivers — the giants and the grinders.
Let's break it down:

<InfoGrid showContainer={true} containerClassName="border border-[#182538]">
  <InfoGridItem
    title="US Large Cap Market Cap"
    value="$54 Trillion. 87% of US Market Cap"
    description="The S&P 500 giants. These are the Apple's, Microsoft's, Amazon's. Mature, global, household names. They move markets. When they sneeze, the world catches a cold. More stable, more liquid, lower relative risk—but also slower growth."
  />
  <InfoGridItem
    title="US Small Cap Market Cap"
    value="$8.3 Trillion. 13% of US Market Cap"
    description="The rest of the listed market. Small and mid-sized companies. Higher growth potential, higher risk, wilder swings. Less analyst coverage, thinner liquidity. This is where 10-baggers hide—and where companies go to zero."

        S&P 500 territory. Mature, global companies. Think mega-cap tech,
        blue-chip industrials, pharma giants. Lower volatility, deep liquidity,
        institutional darlings.

        Everything else. Small & mid-caps. Higher growth potential, higher risk.

        where stories turn into rockets—or crashes.

### Who's Actually Playing the Game?

Markets aren't just numbers on a screen. They're made of players — all with different goals, timeframes, and strategies.

<GridList

  containerPadding="3rem"
  containerBorderRadius="1rem"
  containerClassName="border border-[#182538]"

Each of these players moves differently. Banks hedge. Hedge funds speculate. Market makers provide liquidity. Algorithms exploit inefficiencies. Retail traders (that's us) look for setups.

**Your job?** Understand the game they're playing — and <Highlight variant="blue">find your edge</Highlight> within it.

### Why Do Markets Even Exist?

Imagine a world without financial markets.

You want to start a business? Good luck finding investors.<br />
You need to save for retirement? Hope you like stuffing cash under your mattress.<br />
You want to hedge your risk? Too bad.

Markets exist because they solve real problems:

→ **Capital Allocation**: Money flows to where it can grow.<br />
→ **Price Discovery**: Supply and demand find equilibrium.<br />
→ **Risk Management**: Derivatives let you hedge exposure.<br />
→ **Liquidity**: you can turn assets into cash when you need to.<br />
→ **Risk Management**: Derivatives let you hedge exposure.

    Markets are the same. They look random — prices bouncing up and down like

    Without markets? The world would be stuck. No way to transfer risk. No way

    You now understand the massive scale of global financial markets ($1+
