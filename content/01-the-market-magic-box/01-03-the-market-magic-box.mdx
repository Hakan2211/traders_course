In the last lesson, we took the macro view and introduced the <Highlight variant="blue">box as the float</Highlight> —
the container that holds all tradable shares.
Now we're going to zoom way in and look at the micro view.
We're going inside the box to see what's actually happening in there.

Before we dive in, I want to show you the different perspectives we'll be working with throughout the coming lessons.
I'll be using both <Highlight variant="blue">3D</Highlight> and <Highlight variant="blue">2D</Highlight> visualizations to help you understand what's going on.
So there's no confusion when we switch between them, let me show you both perspectives right now.
That way, you'll have a clear understanding whether we're looking at things from a 3D angle or flattening it down to 2D.

Think of it like this: sometimes we need the full three-dimensional view to really see how particles move and interact in space.
Other times, we'll flatten that view down to 2D so it looks more like the charts you're already familiar with.
Both perspectives show the same thing — just from different angles. And switching between them will help you connect what's happening inside the box to what you see on your actual trading screen.
Alright, let's take a look at both views so you know exactly what you're seeing as we move forward.

  <AlertTitle>What's Next: The Particle Model</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    You've seen the box from the outside. Now we're going{' '}
    <strong>inside</strong>. In the next lesson, we'll zoom down to the atomic
    level of the market where each share becomes a particle you can visualize.
    You'll see buyers as green particles and sellers as red particles, all
    drifting inside the float box. This shift in perspective — from abstract
    numbers to living, moving particles — will transform how you read charts.
