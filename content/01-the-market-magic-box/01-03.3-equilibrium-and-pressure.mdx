In the last lesson, we watched what happens when <Highlight variant="green">buyers</Highlight> and <Highlight variant="red">sellers</Highlight> collide — each trade creating volume,
the <Highlight variant="blue">measurable energy</Highlight> inside the market.
The faster and more frequently those particles collided, the higher the volume —
and the stronger the flow of energy through the box.<br/>
When <Highlight variant="yellow">volume surges, energy builds</Highlight>.
And when energy builds, **price eventually moves**.
That’s why we say: _<Highlight variant="blue">volume precedes price</Highlight>_.

Now, let’s bring a bit of order and structure into that motion.
Those trades don’t happen randomly or out of nowhere — they <Highlight variant="blue">cluster around certain price levels</Highlight>.
So in this lesson, we’ll add the idea of <Highlight variant="yellow">price</Highlight> to our model.

Let’s start by giving our box two distinct zones:

→ The **<Highlight variant="red">top area</Highlight>** is filled with red particles — the **<Highlight variant="red">supply zone</Highlight>**, where sellers are active and looking to unload shares.<br/>
→ The **<Highlight variant="green">bottom area</Highlight>** is filled with green particles — the **<Highlight variant="green">demand zone</Highlight>**, where buyers are waiting to accumulate shares.

Now we can see a natural rhythm emerge:<br/>

<Highlight variant="red">Red particles</Highlight> drift downward looking to
sell,
<Highlight variant="green">green particles</Highlight> drift upward looking to
buy. This opposing flow between buyers and sellers creates an auction process —
both sides constantly negotiating to find balance.

In the <Highlight variant="yellow">middle</Highlight> of the box, where these flows meet and collide, we find <Highlight variant="yellow">the spread</Highlight> — <Highlight variant="yellow">the zone where trades actually happen</Highlight>. That narrow band is the current price range, and it's where price discovery
takes place.

**Price Bar**

Now let's add something important: the price bar.
This appears outside the box and shows you the current market price. Watch it carefully.
When <Highlight variant="green">green collisions</Highlight> dominate — when <Highlight variant="green">buyers</Highlight> are winning the battle — the price bar shifts upward.
When <Highlight variant="red">red collisions</Highlight> take over — when <Highlight variant="red">sellers</Highlight> have the upper hand — the price bar moves down.

<Highlight variant="yellow">Price</Highlight> isn't something arbitrary. It's
the direct <Highlight variant="yellow">result</Highlight> of these
<Highlight variant="red">internal forces</Highlight> playing out inside the box.

**Sideline Particles: The Waiting Game**

Here's where things get really interesting. Most of the time,
the fight between sellers and buyers is actually decided by traders
who aren't yet active — they're waiting on the sidelines, watching.

We're going to introduce <Highlight variant="yellow">gray particles</Highlight> outside of the float box.
These represent <Highlight variant="yellow">waiting liquidity</Highlight>, cash on the sidelines ready to step into the action. They could buy, or they could short.
We'll cover shorting later in this module, so for now, let's focus on the buy side with these gray particles.

Think of them as <Highlight variant="yellow">potential energy</Highlight>. They're observing the battle, trying to figure out which side is winning before they commit.

**Sentiment Shift: When the Sidelines Enter**

Now watch what happens when sideline liquidity finally makes a decision and enters the action.
Let's say they decide to buy shares. Suddenly, the upward pressure from all these new buyers overwhelms the sellers.
The green demand zone shifts upward. The price rises.

You'll notice something visual happening here: you now have more collisions happening on the red side, up in the supply zone.
Why? Because those new buyers are pushing price higher, forcing sellers at higher levels to engage.

This is momentum building. This is what FOMO looks like at the particle level. Gray particles fade into green, enter the box,
and the balance of power shifts.

  <AlertDescription>
    Use the Step control in the Leva panel to progress through the
    visualization:
    <br />
    <strong>Step 0:</strong> Start with particles randomly distributed in the
    box.
    <br />
    <strong>Step 1:</strong> Watch red particles (sellers) move to the top area,
    with more density at the top. Green particles (buyers) move to the bottom
    area, with more density at the bottom.
    <br />
    <strong>Step 2:</strong> The spread area in the middle is highlighted and
    labeled. This is where trades happen.
    <br />
    <strong>Step 3:</strong> Collisions are enabled in the spread area. Watch as
    red and green particles collide, creating transactions.
    <br />
    <strong>Show Sideline Particles:</strong> Toggle to see gray particles
    outside the box representing waiting liquidity.
    <br />
    <strong>Sideline Enters as Buyers:</strong> When enabled, sideline particles
    enter as green buyers, pushing the demand zone higher and increasing price.

**Compression and Expansion: The Breathing Market**

Finally, let's look at something that happens all the time in real markets: <Highlight variant="yellow">compression and expansion</Highlight>.

Watch what happens when the <Highlight variant="red">bottom</Highlight> and <Highlight variant="green">top</Highlight> zones start pressing inward.
The spread becomes narrow. Particles are moving in a tighter and tighter range.
This is <Highlight variant="yellow">consolidation</Highlight>. The market is compressing, like a coiled spring storing energy.

Price tends to move sideways during this phase.
Volume often drops because fewer people are willing to trade in this uncertain, tight range. But pressure is building.

Then, when the zones expand back outward again, that's when price might breakout. The spring releases.
Energy that was stored during compression suddenly flows in one direction.

**Why Does This Happen?**

There are a few reasons why compression leads to expansion:

→ <Highlight variant="accent">Information Catalyst:</Highlight> News hits the market — earnings, economic data, geopolitical events. Suddenly, sideline participants make a decision. Gray particles flood in on one side, overwhelming the balance.<br/>
→ <Highlight variant="accent">Liquidity Hunt:</Highlight> Institutional players push price just beyond the edge of the compressed range to trigger stop losses.
This creates a cascade of forced buying or selling, which fuels the breakout.<br/>
→ <Highlight variant="accent">Exhaustion:</Highlight> One side simply runs out of ammunition. Sellers who wanted to exit have all exited.
Now there's no resistance left, and buyers push through easily.<br/>
→ <Highlight variant="accent">Accumulation Complete:</Highlight> Smart money has been quietly absorbing supply during the consolidation phase. Once they've filled their positions, they let price run.

Whatever the reason, the pattern is the same: compression stores energy, expansion releases it.

**Equilibrium is Temporary**

Here's the key insight from this lesson: <Highlight variant="red">equilibrium — that balance between buyers and sellers — is always temporary</Highlight>.
The market is constantly breathing. It compresses, it expands. It finds balance, then loses it again.

When you see particles drifting calmly with minimal collisions, that's equilibrium. The forces are balanced.
But watch closely. That balance never lasts. One side will gain energy,
the sidelines will pick a direction, and the whole system will shift.

Your job as a trader is to read these shifts before they happen.
Watch where the gray particles are gathering. Watch the compression zones tightening.
Watch the volume patterns shifting.
These are the clues that tell you where the next expansion will occur.

  <AlertTitle>Key Takeaway</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    When buyers and sellers clash, pressure builds. Price stabilizes where
    forces balance — but equilibrium never lasts. As one side gains energy, the
    balance shifts and the price must move.

  <AlertTitle>What You've Learned</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    You now understand that the market is divided into distinct zones: the top
    area (supply/sellers in red), the bottom area (demand/buyers in green), and
    the middle spread where transactions actually happen. You've seen how
    sideline particles (gray) represent waiting liquidity that can dramatically
    shift market dynamics when they decide to enter. You've witnessed
    compression (the spring loading) and expansion (the release) — how tight
    consolidation stores energy that eventually explodes in one direction. Most
    crucially, you've learned that equilibrium is always temporary. The balance
    between buyers and sellers constantly breaks and reforms, creating the
    endless rhythm of price movement. One side gains energy, the balance shifts,
    and price must move.

  <AlertTitle>What's Next: The Battle Inside the Box</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    Now that you understand the zones and equilibrium, it's time to watch the
    war unfold in real-time. In the next lesson, you'll see the constant
    tug-of-war between buyers and sellers play out through interactive controls.
    You'll manually shift buy and sell pressure to understand how dominance
    creates movement, how exhaustion creates reversals, and how equilibrium
    creates consolidation. This is where you'll truly <strong>feel</strong> the
    market as a living battlefield where every candle, spike, and range is the
    direct result of this eternal push and pull between opposing forces.
