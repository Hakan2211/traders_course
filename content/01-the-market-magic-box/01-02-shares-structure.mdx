## Share Structure & The IPO Process

Here's what we're going to do: I want to give you a solid framework that explains what's really happening behind the charts.
Almost everything in technical analysis — every price move, every discovery of a new price level,
every auction — comes down to <Highlight variant="blue">supply and demand</Highlight>. (Remember those curves from economics class?)

But before we jump into what I call the <Highlight variant="blue">Magic Market Box</Highlight> Framework, we need to understand the <Highlight variant="yellow">share structure</Highlight> first.
Think of this as zooming out to see the bigger picture before we zoom back in on the details.
Think of this as building a house – you need a solid foundation before you start decorating the rooms.

### The Share Structure

Let's start with a question: When you buy a share of stock, what exactly are you buying?
And how many of those shares actually exist?

This brings us to four key concepts that confuse almost everyone at first:<br/>

<GridList
  items={[
    {
      title: 'Authorized Shares',
      titleColor: '#4287f5',
      accentColor: '#4287f5',
    },
    {
      title: 'Issued Shares',
      titleColor: '#42f5a7',
      accentColor: '#42f5a7',
    },
    {
      title: 'Outstanding Shares',
      titleColor: '#f542b3',
      accentColor: '#f542b3',
    },
    {
      title: 'The Float',
      titleColor: '#D4AF37',
      accentColor: '#D4AF37',
    },
  ]}
/>

Don't worry if these sound complicated — they're actually pretty simple once you see how they fit together.

### Let's Build a Company Together: The IPO Process

Imagine you're the founder of a company — let's call it <span style={{ color: '#4287f5', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>TechNova Inc.</span>.
You've got a great idea, you've built a product, and now you're ready to go public through an IPO (Initial Public Offering).

Here's what happens:

**<Highlight variant="blue">Authorized Shares:</Highlight> The Maximum Ceiling**

When you incorporate your company, you (and your lawyers) decide on a number: **How many shares can this company ever have?**

That number is your **authorized shares**. It's the absolute maximum—the ceiling.
You can't go higher than this unless you change your corporate charter (which requires shareholder approval).

**Who decides this number?**

→ The **founders** and their legal team decide during incorporation.<br/>
→ Later, if the company wants to increase it, shareholders must vote to approve the change.

**Think of it like this:**

You're creating a box that can hold 100 million marbles (shares).
That's the maximum capacity. You don't have to fill the whole box right away — but you can't put in more than 100 million unless you get a bigger box.

**<Highlight variant="blue">Example:</Highlight>** You decide on 100 million authorized
shares.

**Important Points:**

→ This is the absolute maximum<br/>
→ You can't go above this number without shareholder approval<br/>
→ It's like a bucket/box that can hold 100 million shares – but you don't have to fill it all at once<br/>
→ The company's board and lawyers typically decide this based on future growth plans and potential dilution from future issuances<br/>

**<Highlight variant="green">Issued Shares:</Highlight> What Actually Gets Distributed**

Just because you can create 100 million shares doesn't mean you will — at least not right away.

Issued shares are the shares that the company has actually created and given out to someone:

<GridList
  items={[
    {
      title: 'You (the founder) and co-founders',
      titleColor: '#4287f5',
      accentColor: '#4287f5',
    },
    {
      title: 'early employees (through stock options)',
      titleColor: '#42f5a7',
      accentColor: '#42f5a7',
    },
    {
      title: 'Venture Capital Investors',
      titleColor: '#f542b3',
      accentColor: '#f542b3',
    },
    {
      title: 'the public (during the IPO)',
      titleColor: '#D4AF37',
      accentColor: '#D4AF37',
    },
  ]}
/>

These shares come from the authorized pool.

**<Highlight variant="blue">Example:</Highlight>** From your 100 million authorized, you might issue 60 million shares:

→ 30 million to founders and early employees<br/>
→ 10 million to venture capital (VC) investors<br/>
→ 20 million to the public during the IPO

The remaining 40 million stay unissued — they're reserved for future fundraising, employee stock options, or acquisitions.

**<Highlight variant="red">Outstanding Shares:</Highlight> What's Actually Out There**

Now here's where it gets interesting.

Outstanding shares are all the issued shares that are currently held by shareholders — excluding any shares the company has bought back (called treasury shares).

<Alert variant="info">
  <AlertTitle>Outstanding Shares Formula</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    Outstanding Shares = Issued Shares - Treasury Shares
  </AlertDescription>
</Alert>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Example:</Highlight>**

→ TechNova issued 60 million shares.<br/>
→ Later, the company repurchases 5 million shares (maybe to reward employees or because they think the stock is undervalued).<br/>
→ Those 5 million become treasury shares.<br/>
→ So now you have: 60M − 5M = 55 million outstanding shares.

**<Highlight variant="yellow">The Float:</Highlight> What Traders Can Actually Trade**

This is the number that matters most for us as traders.

The float is the portion of outstanding shares that are **freely tradable** by the public. It excludes:

→ Shares held by insiders (founders, executives)<br/>
→ Restricted shares (locked up, can't be sold yet)<br/>
→ Shares held by large institutions that rarely trade

<Alert variant="info">
  <AlertTitle>Float Formula</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    Float = Outstanding Shares - Shares Held by Insiders - Restricted Shares -
    Shares Held by Large Institutions
  </AlertDescription>
</Alert>

**<Highlight variant="blue">Example:</Highlight>**

→ TechNova has 55 million outstanding shares.<br/>
→ 20 million are held by founders and insiders (locked up for 6 months post-IPO).<br/>
→ That leaves 35 million shares in the float — the shares you and I can actually trade.<br/>

**Why does this matter?**

<Alert variant="warning">
  <AlertTitle>Float Matters</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    The smaller the float, the more volatile the stock can be. With fewer shares
    available, big buy or sell orders can move the price dramatically.
  </AlertDescription>
</Alert>

**Market Cap: Comparing Companies**

**Market capitalization (market cap)** is how we measure the total value of a company in the stock market.

<Alert variant="info">
  <AlertTitle>Market Cap Formula</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    Market Cap = Outstanding Shares x Current Stock Price

    <strong>Imagine your company is a pizza:</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>Authorized</strong> = You decide your pizza can have 8 slices max.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>Issued</strong> = You cut 6 slices and serve them (2 slices still
    uncut).
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>Outstanding</strong> = 5 slices that people are currently eating (you
    bought back 1 slice).
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>Treasury</strong> = You buy back 1 slice (it's sitting in your

### The IPO Process: How TechNova Goes Public

Now that you understand the share structure, let's walk through what happens during an IPO.

**<Highlight variant="blue">Before the IPO:</Highlight>**

→ Founders hold most of the shares (maybe Class B shares with extra voting power).<br/>
→ Early investors (VCs) hold preferred stock (more on this in a sec).<br/>
→ Employees have stock options.

**<Highlight variant="blue">IPO Launch:</Highlight>**

→ The company works with investment banks (underwriters) to determine:<br/>
• How many shares to sell to the public<br/>
• What price to set<br/>

→ Let's say TechNova decides to offer 15 million shares to the public at $50/share.<br/>
→That raises $750 million (minus fees).

**<Highlight variant="blue">After the IPO:</Highlight>**

→ Those 15 million shares become part of the float.<br/>
→ Founders and insiders usually have a lock-up period (typically 90–180 days) where they can't sell their shares.<br/>
→ Once the lock-up expires, more shares enter the float, which can affect the stock price.

### Stock Classes: Different Types of Shares

Here's something that confuses a lot of people: not all shares are created equal.

When a company sets its authorized shares, it can divide them into **different classes**, each with different rights.

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Common Stock</Highlight>**

This is what most of us buy when we trade.

→ **Voting rights** (usually 1 vote per share)<br/>
→ **Dividends** (if the company pays them—but they vary)<br/>
→ **Last in line** if the company goes bankrupt<br/>
→ **Growth potential** — your upside comes from the stock price increasing

**<Highlight variant="blue">Example:</Highlight>**

→ **Class A Common Stock** = what the public buys (1 vote per share)<br/>
→ **Class B Common Stock** = what founders keep (10 votes per share)<br/>

This is how founders like Mark Zuckerberg (Meta) and Larry Page/Sergey Brin (Google) maintain control even though they own a minority of shares.

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Preferred Stock</Highlight>**

This is more like a hybrid between a stock and a bond, usually held by early investors or institutions looking for stability:

→ **Fixed dividends** (like bond interest)<br/>
→ **Priority in liquidation** (gets paid before common stockholders)<br/>
→ **Usually no voting rights** (or very limited)<br/>
→ **Sometimes convertible into common stock**

**What happens at IPO?**

Most preferred stock converts into common stock when a company goes public.

**Why Have Different Classes?**

<span style={{ color: 'gold', fontWeight: 'bold', fontSize: '1.3rem' }}>
  Control.
</span>

Founders want to raise money without losing decision-making power.

**Real-World Examples:**

<Table>
  <TableHeader>
    <TableRow>
      <TableHead>Company</TableHead>
      <TableHead>Class A (Public)</TableHead>
      <TableHead>Class B (Founders)</TableHead>
    </TableRow>
  </TableHeader>
  <TableBody>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>Google</TableCell>
      <TableCell>1 vote/share</TableCell>
      <TableCell>10 votes/share</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>Meta (Facebook)</TableCell>
      <TableCell>1 vote/share</TableCell>
      <TableCell>10 votes/share</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>Snap Inc.</TableCell>
      <TableCell>0 votes/share</TableCell>
      <TableCell>1 vote/share (founders only)</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
  </TableBody>
</Table>
<br />

So even if founders own 20% of the shares, they might control 60% of the votes.

**Putting It All Together: TechNova's Share Structure**

Authorized: 100 million shares, divided into classes:

<Table>
  <TableHeader>
    <TableRow>
      <TableHead>Class</TableHead>
      <TableHead>Type</TableHead>
      <TableHead>Number of Shares</TableHead>
      <TableHead>Rights/Features</TableHead>
    </TableRow>
  </TableHeader>
  <TableBody>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>Class A</TableCell>
      <TableCell>Common</TableCell>
      <TableCell>80M</TableCell>
      <TableCell>1 vote/share (public)</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>Class B</TableCell>
      <TableCell>Common</TableCell>
      <TableCell>10M</TableCell>
      <TableCell>10 votes/share (founders)</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>Class P</TableCell>
      <TableCell>Preferred</TableCell>
      <TableCell>10M</TableCell>
      <TableCell>Fixed dividends, liquidation priority</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
  </TableBody>
</Table>
<br />
**<Highlight variant="blue">Before the IPO:</Highlight>**

→ Founders hold Class B (super voting)<br/>
→ VCs hold Preferred (protection)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">During the IPO:</Highlight>**

→ Preferred converts to Class A Common<br/>
→ Public buys Class A Common (1 vote each)<br/>

**<Highlight variant="blue">After the IPO:</Highlight>**

→ Founders keep control through Class B<br/>
→ Public trades Class A<br/>
→ Float = Only the Class A shares not held by insiders

### Why This Matter For Trading

Now you might be thinking: "Why do I need to know all this? I just want to trade!"

Here's why it matters:

→ **<Highlight variant="yellow">Float size affects volatility:</Highlight>** A small float means less supply, which means bigger price swings<br/>
→ **<Highlight variant="yellow">Lockup expirations matter:</Highlight>** When insider shares unlock, supply increases dramatically<br/>
→ **<Highlight variant="yellow">Market cap comparisons:</Highlight>** You need outstanding shares to calculate market cap properly<br/>
→ **<Highlight variant="yellow">Institutional ownership:</Highlight>** If institutions own 80% of the float, only 20% is truly available for retail traders<br/>

## Next Up: The Magic Market Box Framework

Now that you understand the macro structure — where shares come from and how they're distributed — we can zoom in on the float.

The <Highlight variant="yellow">float</Highlight> is where all the <Highlight variant="green">action</Highlight> happens. It's where supply meets demand. It's where traders like us operate.

But here's the thing: not all floats are created equal.

<Alert variant="warning">
  <AlertTitle>Float Size = Volatility Potential</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    If there are only a few shares available to trade (small float), and
    suddenly everyone wants to buy, what happens to the price?
    <br />
    <strong>
      It <del>explodes</del> goes upwards!
    </strong>
    <br />
    Why? Because there aren't enough shares to go around. Buyers are competing
    for a limited supply, so they have to pay higher and higher prices.
    <br />
    The opposite is also true: if everyone wants to sell a small float stock,
    the price can crater fast because there aren't enough buyers to absorb the
    selling pressure.

I created a 3D visualization in my first article on my homepage: <CustomLink href="https://hakanda.com/articles/mastering-small-cap-equities">"Mastering small-cap equities: The crucial third stage of learning</CustomLink>.

I want to implement here again to give you a feeling how the float could impact the acceleration, speed, damping
and other parameters of the market dynamics.

### Interactive Float Visualization

Click on each box below to see how different float sizes affect the market dynamics. Notice how:

- **<Highlight variant="red">Small float (1M)</Highlight>**: Moves quickly with high acceleration - representing high volatility
- **<Highlight variant="green">Medium float (10M)</Highlight>**: Balanced movement with moderate damping
- **<Highlight variant="yellow">Large float (50M)</Highlight>**: Moves slowly with heavy damping - representing low volatility and stability

The physics simulation demonstrates how float size directly impacts how fast prices can move. Smaller floats create a "springy" market that reacts quickly to buying or selling pressure, while larger floats create a "dampened" market that resists rapid price changes.

<CanvasWrapper height="800px" cameraSettings={{ position: [0, 1, 17] }}>
  <InteractiveFloat />
</CanvasWrapper>

### Real-World Example

Let's say two stocks both get $10 million in buying pressure in one day:

**<Highlight variant="red">Stock A (Small Float: 5M shares, trading at $10)</Highlight>**

→ That $10M represents 1 million shares (10% of the entire float!)<br/>
→ Result: Price could jump 20-50% or more in a single day

**<Highlight variant="yellow">Stock B (Large Float: 500M shares, trading at $10)</Highlight>**

→ That same $10M represents 1 million shares (only 0.2% of the float)<br/>
→ Result: Price might move 1-2%

<span style={{ color: '#4287f5', fontWeight: 'bold', fontSize: '1.2rem' }}>
  Same dollar amount. Completely different impact.
</span>
<br />

This is why small float stocks are often favorites for momentum traders and why they can be so explosive (and risky).

### Why This Matters For Your Trading

Understanding float size helps you:

→ **<Highlight variant="yellow">Anticipate volatility</Highlight>** — Small float = expect big moves<br/>
→ **<Highlight variant="yellow">Size your positions appropriately</Highlight>** — Don't oversize on volatile small floats<br/>
→ **<Highlight variant="yellow">Understand price action</Highlight>** — Why did this stock move 30% on seemingly low volume? Small float.<br/>
→ **<Highlight variant="yellow">Identify opportunity</Highlight>** — Small floats can offer outsized gains (and losses)<br/>

### The Transition: Inside The Magic Market Box

So we've established the box — the float. We understand that the size of the box determines how much the price can move with a given amount of pressure.

But now we need to go **<Highlight variant="green">inside the box</Highlight>**.

What's actually happening in there?

Volume. Buyers. Sellers. Supply. Demand.

In the next lesson, we're going to dive deep into the volume within the float — who's buying,
who's selling, and how that battle between supply and demand creates the price action we see on our charts.

We're going to explore:

→ **<Highlight variant="blue">The players:</Highlight>** retail traders, institutions, market makers, algorithms<br/>
→ **<Highlight variant="blue">The forces:</Highlight>** buy pressure vs. sell pressure<br/>
→ **<Highlight variant="blue">The signals:</Highlight>** how volume tells us who's winning the battle<br/>
→ **<Highlight variant="blue">The framework:</Highlight>** how to visualize this using the Market Box<br/>

This is where technical analysis comes alive. This is where you start seeing the market as a living,
breathing auction — not just random lines on a chart.

Let's go inside the box.

<Alert variant="success">
  <AlertTitle>What You've Learned</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    You now understand the complete share structure hierarchy: Authorized Shares
    (maximum capacity), Issued Shares (what's been created), Treasury Shares
    (bought back by company), Outstanding Shares (held by shareholders), and The
    Float (what's freely tradable). You've walked through TechNova's IPO process
    and discovered how different stock classes (Common vs. Preferred, Class A
    vs. Class B) give founders control even with minority ownership. Most
    importantly, you've learned that float size directly impacts volatility — a
    small float creates explosive price moves with minimal volume, while a large
    float provides stability but requires massive pressure to move. You can now
    see why a $10M buy order moves a 5M float stock 30% but barely budges a 500M
    float stock.
