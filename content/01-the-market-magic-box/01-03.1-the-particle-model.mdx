Up until now, you've been looking at the market from the outside — the arena, the different layers,
the box itself. Now we're <Highlight variant="green">going inside</Highlight>. We're zooming down to the atomic level of the market to see
what really happens when trades occur. This shift in perspective is going to transform how you read charts forever.

## The Particle Universe

Let's start with the basics. Remember what we learned about <Highlight variant="yellow">the float</Highlight>? Every stock has one.
The float represents all the <Highlight variant="yellow">freely tradable shares</Highlight> that you and I — the public — can actually buy and sell.
Now here's where it gets interesting. We're going to represent <Highlight variant="red">each share in the float with one particle</Highlight>.
Think of it like this: the bigger the float, the more particles (shares) we have in the box.
And visually, that means you'll see a bigger box on your screen.<br/><Highlight variant="blue">Each particle</Highlight> represents <Highlight variant="blue">a share owned by someone</Highlight>.<br/>
Here's the key thing to understand:<Highlight variant="red"> ownership never disappears</Highlight>.
Shares don't just vanish into thin air — they just <Highlight variant="blue">move between people</Highlight>.
There are buyers, and there are sellers. To keep things crystal clear, let's visualize buyers with green particles
and sellers with red particles. That way, we have a clean separation between them.
For example, let's say Jack owns a particle but wants to sell it — so he shows up
as a red particle. Laura owns a particle too, but she wants to buy more — so she's
a green particle. Simple, right? Right now, we're looking at the market at rest.
The shares exist, they're out there, but nothing major is happening yet. People own
these particle — these shares — but they're not doing anything with them at the moment.
Just sitting there, waiting. But here's the bigger picture: inside every stock lies
a finite universe of tradable shares. These particles never vanish — they simply
change hands, one by one. What you see as "the market" is really millions of these
tiny exchanges happening simultaneously, all the time. In the next lesson, we're
going to watch these particles come alive. We'll learn about <Highlight variant="blue">transactions</Highlight> — what
happens when a red particle meets a green particle, and how that creates the movement
you see on your charts. For now, just get comfortable with this view. Watch the particles
drift. See the box. Understand that this is the foundation of everything that follows.

  <AlertTitle>Explore the 3D Visualization</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    In the 3D visualization below, you can see the particles — each one representing a share of the float. 
    Take a moment to play around with the controls and get a feel for how everything works.

    Use the particle count slider to increase or decrease the number of particles.
    As you do this, watch how the float size and box adjust automatically. You can also change the particle size if you want,
    though that's just for visual preference right now — it doesn't affect the concept.

    Once you're ready, click the "Show Red/Green Particles" button to colorize them.
    This reveals who's who: the buyers and the sellers.
    You'll immediately see the separation between the two sides of the market.

    Finally, click the "Enable Brownian Motion" button to bring the particles to life.
    They'll start drifting and moving around inside the box — but notice,
    they're not colliding with each other yet. This is the market at rest, just gently breathing.

  <AlertTitle>Key Takeaway</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    The float isn't some abstract concept — it's a real, countable number of
    shares. Every particle, every share, always belongs to someone. The box
    contains everything that can trade. And when particles move between owners,
    that's when price discovery begins. That's when the market starts to
    breathe.

  <AlertTitle>What You've Learned</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    You've shifted from viewing the market as abstract numbers to seeing it as a
    particle universe where each share is a physical entity that can be
    visualized. You now understand that the float represents a finite collection
    of particles (shares) that never disappear — they only change hands. By
    representing buyers as green particles and sellers as red particles, you've
    gained a visual framework for understanding ownership and market dynamics at
    the atomic level. You've seen the market at rest, with particles drifting in
    Brownian motion, waiting for collisions that will create transactions and
    price discovery.

  <AlertTitle>What's Next: Energy and Motion</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    The particles are alive and drifting — but they're not colliding yet. In the
    next lesson, we'll introduce <strong>energy</strong> into the system. You'll
    learn what happens when buyers and sellers bring momentum into the box, how
    collisions create transactions, and why faster-moving particles (higher
    velocity) lead to more aggressive price discovery. This is where the market
    transitions from resting to active, from potential to kinetic. Get ready to
    see your first transaction happen in real-time, particle by particle.
