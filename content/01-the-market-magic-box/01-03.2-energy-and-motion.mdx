Now let's bring the box to life. Watch what happens when **<Highlight variant="green">green</Highlight> and <Highlight variant="red">red</Highlight> particles collide**.
This is a transaction between a <Highlight variant="green">buyer</Highlight> and a <Highlight variant="red">seller</Highlight> happening right in front of you.
**<Highlight variant="blue">Every collision</Highlight>** you see means a trade is taking place — **<Highlight variant="blue">one particle changing hands</Highlight>**.

Want to move price? You need a surge in collisions. You need <Highlight variant="yellow">energy</Highlight>.
That's why we say **volume precedes price**.
The energy builds first — you see the collisions increasing — and then price reacts.
It's cause and effect.

Watch the volume meter as collisions ramp up. That rising bar is telling you something important:
conviction is building. Participants are committing. <Highlight variant="yellow">Energy</Highlight> is flowing into the system.

And when that energy fades? When collisions slow down? That's when price stalls, consolidates, or reverses.
The market is catching its breath.

  <AlertTitle>Watch the Collisions</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    In the visualization below, you can see red particles (sellers) and green
    particles (buyers) moving around. First, observe them drifting without
    collisions. Then, use the Leva controls panel (top right) to enable
    collisions by checking "Enable Collisions". Watch what happens when they
    collide: the red particle dissolves, and the green particle becomes a larger
    "bag" containing two particles. This represents the transaction — ownership
    transfer from seller to buyer. You can also adjust the collision intensity
    to see how volume (the number of collisions) relates to market energy.

  <AlertTitle>Key Takeaway</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    Each time two particles meet, a trade is born. The faster they collide, the
    more energy fills the market — that energy is what we call volume.

  <AlertTitle>What You've Learned</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    You've discovered how transactions create energy in the market — each
    collision between buyers and sellers transfers ownership and generates
    volume. You now understand that particles (shares) are never created or
    destroyed in trades, only transferred, and that volume is the measurable
    energy flowing through the market. Most importantly, you've learned the
    foundational principle: <strong>volume precedes price</strong>. Energy
    builds through collisions first, then price responds. When collisions surge,
    conviction is building; when they slow, the market is catching its breath.
    You can now see trades not as abstract numbers but as physical collisions
    happening in real-time.

  <AlertTitle>What's Next: Equilibrium and Pressure</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    Those collisions don't happen randomly — they cluster around specific price
    levels where buyers and sellers meet. In the next lesson, we'll add{' '}
    <strong>structure</strong> to the chaos by introducing supply and demand
    zones. You'll see how sellers concentrate at the top (supply), buyers gather
    at the bottom (demand), and battles rage in the middle (the spread). You'll
    also discover how sideline liquidity — the gray particles watching and
    waiting — can shift the entire balance of power when they finally decide to
    enter. Get ready to watch the market breathe through compression and
    expansion.
